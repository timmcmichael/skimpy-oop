/*
 * This program demonstrates the VinylRecord class by creating and displaying information about several instances.
 * 
 * It also demonstrates the use of a "helper" method to display the information about a VinylRecord object--that means I don't have to write the same println() statements over and over. Instead, I pass an object into that method, which then does the outputting.
 * 
 * NOTE: This is the code that was completed by the end of the video and is not the starter file. Because it's been renamed, it doesn't compile. See VinylRecordDemo.java for the starter file.
