# 5A - Boolean Logic

You've heard of faulty logic. You've heard of circular logic. You've even heard of logic puzzles. But have you heard of Boolean logic? Stop being wishy-washy and dealing with gray areas--start dealing with simple true or false!

Learn a little about boolean variables; learn about relational or comparison operators like equal to, or greater than; and learn about logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT. Well, not very much about those last ones, but you'll at least learn what symbols they use. Also, learn a fun new name for an exclamation point! Just try not to offend people with it.

Pop quiz: Boolean logic is the best kind of logic. True or False?

# 5B - If-Else Statements



Setters are great, but they just require So. Much. Typing. My precious little fingers can hardly take it! I just wish there was a way to jam all the values I want into an object at once.

Constructors, to the rescue! Learn how a default constructor initializes an object when we don't create a constructor of your own. Then, learn how to create a constructor of your own. You'll have so much fun making a constructor that you'll then learn to override it so you can have even more fun!
