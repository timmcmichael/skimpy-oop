# 5A - Boolean Logic

You've heard of faulty logic. You've heard of circular logic. You've even heard of logic puzzles. But have you heard of Boolean logic? Stop being wishy-washy and dealing with gray areas--start dealing with simple true or false!

Learn a little about boolean variables; learn about relational or comparison operators like equal to, or greater than; and learn about logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT. Well, not very much about those last ones, but you'll at least learn what symbols they use. Also, learn a fun new name for an exclamation point! Just try not to offend people with it.

Pop quiz: Boolean logic is the best kind of logic. True or False?

# 5B - If-Else Statements

Look, we've all seen it. Your programs are feeling weighed down by life's tough decisions. They've reached a fork in the road, and they're just not sure which way to go. They need a little guidance, a little structure, a little...if-elsey goodness.

if-statements are no laughing matter, so we won't be joking around in this video. See how to write an if statement that uses boolean logic to determine whether or not a block of code executes. Then see how to add an else block to make a structure that decides between two chunks of code.

# 5C - if-else if Statements

I can remember when my programs were just tiny little applications, full of hope and dreams--but unable to make anything but the most basic decisions. But now they're like obnosxious teenagers, and they're no longer satisfied with simple yes-or-no answers. They crave nuance, they demand options. Eventually, you have to let your programs go out and make tricky decisions. 

This video will show you how to use your newfangled if-else expertise to encapsulate your objects a little better, but they we'll jump right into if-else if structures that let our code choose from multiple options.
