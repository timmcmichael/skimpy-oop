# 5A - Boolean Logic

You've heard of faulty logic. You've heard of circular logic. You've even heard of logic puzzles. But have you heard of Boolean logic? Stop being wishy-washy and dealing with gray areas--start dealing with simple true or false!

Learn a little about boolean variables; learn about relational or comparison operators like equal to, or greater than; and learn about logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT. Well, not very much about those last ones, but you'll at least learn what symbols they use. Also, learn a fun new name for an exclamation point! Just try not to offend people with it.

Pop quiz: Boolean logic is the best kind of logic. True or False?

# 5B - If-Else Statements

Look, we've all seen it. Your programs are feeling weighed down by life's tough decisions. They've reached a fork in the road, and they're just not sure which way to go. They need a little guidance, a little structure, a little...if-elsey goodness.

if-statements are no laughing matter, so we won't be joking around in this video. See how to write an if statement that uses boolean logic to determine whether or not a block of code executes. Then see how to add an else block to make a structure that decides between two chunks of code.
