# 5A - Boolean Logic

You've heard of faulty logic. You've heard of circular logic. You've even heard of logic puzzles. But have you heard of Boolean logic? Stop being wishy-washy and dealing with gray areas--start dealing with simple true or false conditions!

Learn a little about boolean variables; learn about relational or comparison operators like "equal to" or "greater than"; and learn about logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT. Well, not very much about those last ones, but you'll at least learn what symbols they use. Also, learn a fun new name for an exclamation point! Just try not to offend people with it.

Pop quiz: Boolean logic is the best kind of logic. True or False?

# 5B - If-Else Statements

Look, we've all seen it. Your programs are feeling weighed down by life's tough decisions. They've reached a fork in the road, and they're just not sure which way to go. They need a little guidance, a little structure, a little...if-elsey goodness.

if-statements are no laughing matter, so we won't be joking around in this video. See how to write an if statement that uses boolean logic to determine whether or not a block of code executes. Then see how to add an else block to make a structure that decides between two chunks of code.

# 5C - if-else if Statements

I can remember when of my programs were just tiny little applications, full of hope and dreams--but unable to make anything but the most basic decisions. But now they're like obnosxious teenagers, and they're no longer satisfied with simple yes-or-no answers. They crave nuance, they demand options. Eventually, you have to let your programs go out and make tricky decisions. 

This video will show you how to use your newfangled if-else expertise to encapsulate your objects a little better, but they we'll jump right into if-else if structures that let our code choose from multiple options.

# 5D - Nested if Statements

With our programs growing up so fast, making decisive and complex decisions, you might be starting to worry--what happens when your programs go out on their own? Will you end up an empty nester, with nothing but a few lines of code to remember them by?

This video will show you how to keep your nest full. Full of if statements, of course. We'll look at nested if statements, which are if statements inside of if statements. It's like a Russian nesting doll of decisions! And they let us make hierarchical decisions, where one decision depends on another.
