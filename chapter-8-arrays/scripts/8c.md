arrays by themselves can be helpful and they can be useful but what really unlocks their potential is using them in the context of loops and using Loops to process them that's what we're going to talk about now I'm assuming here that you already have a basic understanding of what arrays are and a basic uh understanding of how to create them in Java so if that's not the case you need to stop here and go back and watch those videos and then come back and we'll be ready to go the other thing I want to mention before we jump in is that uh the japa developers have created some tools that will do some of the things we're going to do uh in our lesson for us for example the arrays class does some of this stuff and I want to acknowledge that that's out there and that if you're writing code in a production environment or if you're writing code outside a class that's probably really useful for you unfortunately I need to assess your ability to do things with loops yourself not to call a method that does it for you so I'm going to ask you to write that code yourself rather than using the arrays class or some other class you find that will do some of this work for you um that's why the assignments are worded in a way that require loose and I just think it's important to acknowledge that it's not like I don't know those things exist and it's not like I don't think you would use those in the quote unquote qu real world but I have to see if you can write a loop that deals with an array okay with all that said let's take a look in Visual Studio code how we can do this All right so I've just got a couple arrays here for us to work with one is an array of strings and one is an array of doubles and to start out with let's just take a look at outputting one of these arrays so if I just say output you know print line team let's go ahead and run that and see what we get what you get is probably hard to even see what that is because it's mixed in with all that kind of compiler output but let me show you here in a comment what we got um we got this weird looking um set of information and to make a long story short what it says basically is that this is an array and it's it holds strings and then this is the the address in memory where that is stored it's possibly useful to someone but it's not really useful to us it's certainly not useful to our user um so just printing out that the array itself doesn't really give us something useful if we want to print out what's in the array that might be a little more useful and it's going to be our first example of where we can create what we call a traversal Loop and so a traversal I talked about that in in an earlier video it just means we're going to go through a loop and we're going to do something with every element in it this is going to be done with a for Loop it could be a while loop we're going to write it with a for Loop and it's a for Loop that you're going to write so often that you will soon have it memorized the idea here is that we need a loop that goes through every single valid index in our array the first valid index is always zero and the last valid index is always the length of our array minus one so I'll create a variable called I to be our counter and I'll set it to zero um I is kind of a convention in in programming you can think of it as standing for like an iteration or in the case of an array I like to think of it as representing the index number right uh we're going to continue as long as I is less than the length of the array and this array that we're going to Traverse has six so I'm going to put a six there and I'm going to add one with every iteration so far so good and in fact let's just try it I'll system out line team now we've worked with basic indexing before and so that would print out the um the first element but what it does is it prints that every single time we want that index number to change we really want it to be OD okay now this looks good it actually works I do have one thing I would like to refine on this and that is this Boolean expression that says we're going to uh we're going to keep going as long as we are less than six we may not know the size of our array maybe while the program is running we ask the user how big it needs to be and then we create it um or maybe we come back and change it and we add another name name onto it now we know that an array is immutable from one of those earlier videos so I can't just do this um at runtime I can't just add a name on but I can when I'm coding I may come in and add this and I may forget now to go back and find all of these traversals and remember to change that from a six to a seven and then what happens 20 minutes later when I need to add another name now I got to go change them to eight so what we do instead is we refer to the length of the array and there is a property that will do that so if I say the name of the array is team. length in Java that gives us the length of the array no matter what that is and so I don't have to worry about it I just know that that is always going to correctly Traverse a loop and all you ever have to an array excuse me and all you ever have to change on this line of code is the name of the array here so if I want to Traverse through prices and then I want to print out some prices still works okay so that's a nice little tip to make sure that we are um staying in bounds as we say and not using invalid index numbers all right I'm going to take a moment just to identify that as an output traversal Just for future reference so we know that's what it is and let's try another traversal um something that we can't really do with a string but we could do with with numbers maybe we want to know that the the sum of all of the values in that prices array so this um I'm going to call this an accumulation traversal we always use these funny words for this right so in order to get a total from from this I'm going to need a variable that we call an accumulator uh in other words I'm the price the total that we're adding up so it's going to be a double and and I'm going to call it um total price and I'm going to set it to 0.0 to start out and I'm going to use that same traversal code for in I equal z i is less than in this case prices. length and we're going to say i+ plus okay now what I want to do I don't want to print them out every time what I want to do is add the whatever the current price is onto that total price so this is going to be an assignment statement and there going to be a couple ways to write this I could say um total price equals total price plus now I want to pull from prices so prices at the current index okay and then this we don't want to print it here because that's going to show us kind of the work in progress so we can do that just to see um it helps sort of illustrate what's going on so I guess we might as well print that out uh so I'm going to put total equals plus total price all right let's go and run this and see what we get so first it outputs that it outputs the team names which is fine and then it's going to Output every iteration it's going to say 199 and then 4 24 which is the total at that point so it gives us kind of a running total that may not be exactly what we want it might be what we want but in this case I really just want the total at the end um so this idea of an accumulator is not really done or it's not really correct until the loop is finished so we don't want to do anything with it until the loop is all done so I'm going just just going to print out the total price down at the bottom there we go $21.7 I didn't um add those up ahead of time to see if that's right but I'm going to assume that that is correct um because I have the luxury of not turning this in for an assignment you of course should always be um checking that stuff and not assuming that it is correct uh but this is what we can call an accumulation traversal and I'll point out by the way what if we wanted to figure out the average price well the average price now is going to be uh the total price divided by the number of items in that array which is prices. length so if we took total price divided by prices. length we would get an average so that accumulation U Loop or traversal can be really helpful for a lot of different things all right let's see another example of a traversal and this one I don't know if I have a great name for this this is going to be like a modifier traversal and I don't really talk about these in those terms but just since I'm I'm commenting what they all are a traversal that goes through and somehow changes the values inside the array because they're not static the array itself is immutable but the contents within the array are not and that's we're using immutables in a real specific way um but this is just going to be another traversal let's just say that we need to increase the prices by a dollar each you know inflation or whatever prices. length i++ you can already see as promised we're writing this for for Loop um often here so all right so what I want to do now is an assignment statement that changes um a each element of the array so I'm going to say prices at index I equals prices oh I was going to show you up here um we've done this this kind of update um with kind of the the lonand way we could also say total price plus equals price PR sorry for going backwards here but as I was writing the next line of code I was realizing I never circled back and showed that these two lines of code are are equivalent and most people are going to prefer the second one since it's less typing and that's the one I'm going to use here I want to if I want to add a dollar onto each price and I'm just going to say plus equals 1.0 and now how do I know that worked well I'm going to do a traversal Loop that does output to see so I'm going to copy and paste I'm not a big fan of copying and pasting for beginning programmers but it seems appropriate here since it's just that traversal and I'm going to Output the prices um one of the things that's going to happen is my um is my output window down here is going to get to start looking pretty confusing so I'm just going to add a little divider here almost thought I was in Python there for a second just to so I can see the difference in that output there we go so each one of these now should be a dollar more than where they started so 299 325 3.99 and so on so that has worked as well again this is just showing that these variables that we've put into an array aray these values that we've put into an array we can still modify them we can do anything with them that we could do with a regular double or a regular string or whatever that variable type is all right I paused recording so you wouldn't have to watch me type a bunch of stuff but I have added code that's going to ask the user for a name and we're going to use a traversal Loop to see if that name is on our team uh so I've just added the scanner stuff um that should be pretty common or familiar to you by now and I'm asking the user to type that name in so we're going to use a traversal loop we're going to say 4 in I equals Zer same old Loop that we've been using I is less than I'm doing teams now I'm back to teams I said teams but it's team of course and so what we're going to do now is inside this Loop body when we're now going to do an if statement that checks to see if this name is the current element in the uh in the array so we're going to start with an if statement and now strings we have to use dot equals or uh in order to sorry I can't type in and talk at the same time in order to compare two strings we can't just do or we shouldn't just do this for example team I there's a chance that might work depending on having to do with the way Java runtime handles strings but it's not really going to work so we have to do dot equals it's just a quirk of the Java language most other um languages don't really do it that way anymore okay so if the search name is equal to the current name you know the the name at the current index then let's just output system out line let's print out yes that name is on the team okay let's go ahead and run this and see if it works I didn't even think to test my code that I wrote while I was paused uh so let's search for the name DAV because I know that one is in there yes that name is on the team uh now what happen happens if we don't we don't find a name if I put Tim nothing happens we don't get any output and so what students are tempted to do here is add an else statement right okay well else I didn't find the name just copy that no not on the team okay let's run that and see what we get try first of all let's go I'll try Tim no not on the team so not on the team that it repeats it a bunch of times um let's try one that is on the team deid it says no not on the team oops found it didn't not on the team again remember this if statement is happening inside of a loop so it's going to keep going from there and um we have a couple different ways we can handle it um this might be one of those exceptions to my rule about not breaking out of a loop right we might break there um but I still want to be able to or sorry I put the break see I use these so infrequently I didn't even um I didn't even use it right that's not really going to accomplish exactly what we want since we're doing output um but what we might do instead is something like a Boolean variable so we could say Boolean um is found equals and I set it to false and then we're going to say not that code for later um if the name is now we're going to say is found equals true and now after the loop now that that um Boolean variable is essentially an accumulator and it is not accurate it's not complete until the loop is done uh so I'm going to say now I'm going to use that sorry I Frankenstein together my code here we're going to say if is found then print yes we're on the team else print no not on the team so we're not going to print every time in inside the the loop at all we're not going to print any um information in the loop we're just going to do the search and then when we're done we're going to take a look Tim nope not on the team now the test is if this um finds it and doesn't print anything out yes that name is on the team now this might indeed be a place for a break statement right um because once we found the name we don't have to keep looking so I might break there I don't in a case like this a loop is um like this it's pretty basic we don't need to really cut it off but there's nothing wrong with that because Loop's done served its purpose now it's done so uh we could break it there if we want I hit stop before I I made a point that really where I was headed with this break statement is that we would say that this is an indefinite Loop right we don't know how many times it's going to have to iterate before it find something so this is a case where I probably would really write this as a while loop again my aversion to break statements which is completely unfounded and there's no reason for it but I would probably write a while loop that does this it just says essentially while the names aren equal keep going and it's going to iterate every time at the end and um you'd have to have an or clause in there that stops IT from going out of bounds that's kind of beyond the scope of what we're doing here so I won't bother with that at the moment uh but just pointing out there's another way to do that okay um let's take another uh usage case of an array let's say that we don't know uh how how big the team is or how many players are going to be on it we want to get that information from the user so I'm going to comment that out so this is going to work a little bit differently I'm going to just skip a couple lines to set this off visually so now let's say that we're going to Define this declare this team array but we're not going to say how big it is because we don't know how big it is we're going to have to ask that so I'm going to say um int oh sorry I need to prompt first system that out print number of players and this is the real um python way of writing this line of code that I don't really like but it will say int um num players equals I missed next in is the one I wanted and just because I'm in the habit of doing this I'm going to say import that next line just to clear that buffer because if I don't I'm I'm going to forget and I'll be wondering why my code doesn't work I have to clear that buffer after we've gotten a number out of there um so now we've got a value and this is how big we want the team to be now remember we can't use an initializer at this point because we've already made the array so I'm going to say team equals new notice I'm not putting this part I'm not putting the string brackets because we that's part of the definition uh of the Declaration I should say of this array I've already declared it it exists so but I'm writing the rest of that line of code equals new string and now instead of putting a literal number like six in there I'm putting that num players okay that's great but we don't have any names in the array right we just got all those null pointers so what we're going to do is we're going to use a loop uh to Traverse through the array and collect input okay so this will be like an input traversal so same old um same old traversal code here now what am I doing I should just be copying the one right there instead of making a watch me tip and what we're going to do now is we're going to say string I'm not going to write it the python way here which would not use any new variables but I'm going to write it the Java way or the the teaching way um string new name equals nothing for now um and I'm going to prompt the user say input player name and then we'll say new name is going to be equal to next line and now I want to take that new name and put it into the array at index I so team index I equals new name okay I think that's going to do it and then we're immediately doing a traversal after that so we'll be able to see if this works uh and I'm going to start with a low number because I don't want to do a lot of typing so we say three players I'm say John de Javier there we go John deid Javier uh why did it say Javier twice do I have an error or did I have just an extra line of code hanging out there oh this is just a case of me being dumb U that Javier is my input from that line so which I probably could have avoided that confusion by using a print statement instead of a print line statement um let's try that again just because that's a little embarrassing I got to redeem myself here let's put four names John Marie Vanessa I don't remember the order we used before Vanessa read There we go that there was nothing wrong except for my uh my brain not working correctly all right so uh that is a good example of an input traversal and the last thing I want to show here is just a an illustration of how we don't always have to go through these Loops just a straight traversal of 0 to length minus 5 we can have some variations of that that might be useful for us us so uh for our input traversal here let's reverse that let's say that for some reason we want to Output the names in reverse order so that is really the same idea here but we're going to modify this statement and we'll just fumble our way through it because that's what new students do our new programmers do um instead of starting at zero we're going to say well I'm going to start at team. length and by the way as I work some alarm Bells hopefully are going off so let's just switch those around now I've I could run it and demonstrate this but I'm going to tell you that I already have some some problems here um by the way one of the things I'm going to do for the in the interest of speed is I'm going to comment that out and I'm G to comment that out and I'm going to go back to just my pre initialized array here um should have done that I should have paused and done that but okay so we're going to uh we're switching things around so now we're going to start at Team length and we're going to go um down down to zero and we want to go backwards now there's a problem here let's run this and see what happens oh I've got a different problem because I messed something up one it was uncommenting I think oh I was trying to uh trying to declare that pop set the uh the size of that okay let's try that again no what else did I miss just missed on my un editing I will I will leave this stuff in the video just so you can see that I make all the same dumb mistakes that students make it doesn't mean that I am dumb although I might be but uh it just means I made a dumb mistake so we all do that kind of stuff all right so what has happened is the the program ran but I don't get any names out butut and that's because there's more to it than just kind of switching the order of these um we need to start really at the length um minus one remember because that is the um the last valid index and we need to flip this sign because now we're going the other direction and we're going to say as long as I is greater than zero we're going to keep repeating and let's see how that one works Vanessa Javier deid Danielle and Marie and is that our complete list no we're missing John so this is that OBO error off by one we shorted it by one um we do this says stop um keep going as long as we're above zero but zero is a valid index number that's the first one in our array so I need to say as long as we're greater than or equal to zero and I think that's going to give us what we're after here okay so that's uh that's an example of an array that goes through kind of in reverse order um and then I won't actually code these but I'll just point out there's nothing that says we have to go through one at a time maybe we want to increase the price of every other one so that would be I plus = 2 right instead of adding one um so this is kind of your standard what I would call your standard traversal but you don't have to Traverse your array in that kind of standard way you can go through it backwards you can um you go every other one or every fifth one or whatever whatever you need to do to um to suit the purpose that you're you know to suit to to complete the task that you're after this is another example where in this video I'm I'm only having time to just scratch the surface of what we can do with loops in the context of arrays uh but I've shown you the basic idea of a traversal we can output stuff we can input stuff we can um go through the loops in different the arrays in different ways we can search through an array that kind of stuff all the basics that we need and certainly what we need for the assignments that you're going to get We'll be asking you to use these skills but to maybe do them in slightly different ways so at this point I would encourage you to go off and maybe try some of your own try try making some arrays and looping through them just to make sure you've got this down and email me if you have any questions
