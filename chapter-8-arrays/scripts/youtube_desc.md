# 8A - Introduction to Arrays

We've been spending a lot of time working with variables, and you know what? I think they're getting a little full of themselves. Variables, variables, variables. I'm just so sick of them. I mean, they can only hold one piece of data at a time! I've got big ideas, and I want to store a bunch of pieces of data that are related to each other! It's time to put variables in their place and learn about arrays. 

This video introduces you to arrays. See how they're different than regular old variables. Learn how indexes refer to individual elements in an array, and some of the limitations of arrays.

Array we go!

# 8B - Array Syntax in Java

Remember when you were just a kid and that bully said that you were a zero? You might have thought that was an insult, but computer science, zero is first!

Start out by declaring an array and learning to use indexes to access individual elements. Then, learn some shortcuts for getting data into your array. Finally, see how array elements are really just variables grouped together.
