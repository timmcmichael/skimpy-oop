# 8A - Introduction to Arrays

We've been spending a lot of time working with variables, and you know what? I think they're getting a little full of themselves. Variables, variables, variables. I'm just so sick of them. I mean, they can only hold one piece of data at a time! I've got big ideas, and I want to store a bunch of pieces of data that are related to each other! It's time to put variables in their place and learn about arrays. 

This video introduces you to arrays. See how they're different than regular old variables. Learn how indexes refer to individual elements in an array, and learn some of the limitations of arrays.

Array we go!

# 8B - Array Syntax in Java

Remember when you were just a kid and that bully said that you were a zero? You might have thought that was an insult, but in computer science, zero is first!

Start out by declaring an array and learning to use indexes to access individual elements. Then, learn some shortcuts for getting data into your array. Finally, see how array elements are really just variables grouped together.

# 8C - Loops and Arrays in Java

Have arrays been throwing you for a loop? We're going to start from nothing--well, from zero--and traverse our way through this topic. But be sure not to step out of bounds!

In this video, we explore the use of arrays in Java, particularly focusing on how to process them using loops. We cover various types of traversals, including output, accumulation, and modifier traversals, and demonstrate how to handle arrays dynamically by taking user input for array size and elements. Additionally, we discuss techniques for searching within arrays and modifying array elements, as well as iterating through arrays in reverse order or with custom step sizes.

# 8D - Arrays of Objects in Java

These primitive arrays are a lot of fun and all, but we're fancy-schmancy object-oriented programmers. Time to step up our game and start adding some real live objects to our arrays.

This video explains using arrays that hold objects in Java, specifically focusing on a custom Dog class. It highlights common challenges new programmers face when dealing with arrays of objects and emphasizes that arrays of objects are similar to arrays of primitive types. The video demonstrates how to instantiate objects and add them to an array, perform traversals, and use getter methods to access object properties. It also covers initialization lists with objects.

# 8E - "For-Each" Loops in Java

I've been wearing my precious little fingers down the bone writing all of these traversal loops. I mean, those 'for' loops are just sooooo long. I don't have time to write all of that code! I need a shortcut! Fortunately, lots of programmers want shortcuts, and the Java development team heard our cries. 

In this video, we explore the "for-each" loop in Java, which traverses a loop without making us use an index. We compare the "for-each" loop with traditional "for" loops, highlighting its advantages and limitations.
