most of us when we're first learning to write code we begin with things like variables and we learn about functions or methods and uh then we go on to if statements and loops and depending on your instructor you may have classes and objects thrown in there that's the way that I teach it but many other instructors save those uh concepts for a little bit later but all of those are what I would consider to be basic PR programming fundamentals and when we get to arrays we're now talking about what I consider to be the first sort of intermediate level concept arrays are our first data structure so a data structure is just a way that we can organize information in the computer's memory so that we can make it more efficient to work with and arrays aren't the only data structure uh there are lots of them out there and in many cases those other ones are more efficient choices or better choices but arrays are where they all start and it's where we should all start as programmers in my opinion uh because it ties together a lot of those basic fundamental ideas and it also gives us the foundation for all the other data structure work we're going to do uh later on in our programming lives so what is an array again when we first start programming uh we begin dealing with uh variables to store our data and the anal ology I I always use is that a a variable is like a container where we can store one piece of information right so in this case I'm using a can uh to illustrate that and we can give that variable uh a name or an identifier so that we can refer to it in code and whenever we use that identifier in our code um it's going to go out and look in that container and see what value is there and retrieve that for our use now variables are really powerful they they are the again the kind of a building block for everything we're going to do but they do have some important limits right uh a variable Can Only Hold one piece of information at a time so if I've got this container that's meant to store the name of a player and I put the name John Elway in there well if I come along later and now I want to store the name Payton Manning I can't put them in the same variable if I put pton Manning in there John Elway is gone right it only holds one piece of information at a time I can make other variables of course and I can have a separate one for Payton Manning um but that is a limit of uh of the way we can use variables in our code so this is where arrays come in what if we have a whole bunch of information that's related that we want to store um we can think of that as like a collection and so this would be like a six-pack right so we can take a bunch of variables that are all similar to each other and for some reason they um they they kind of belong as a group and we can combine them into one structure that we can work with as a single entity um so like a sixpack and those individual cans in there are still going to have the same limitations of a variable right it can hold beer or it can hold soda but it can't hold both um but now we've got a way to um to start dealing with bigger data sets than just one piece of information and again we're going to use an identifier to refer to that but the identifier is going to refer to the whole collection not just to one part of the collection and so that's usually reflected in how that we name these right so uh a single container might be called player because it holds the name of one player um our array our six-pack uh might be called team because that's got the names of everybody that's on the team um a six-pack analogy is good for just understanding the basic idea but that's not really the way that data is going to be organized in our computer's memory um so there's a more useful way for us to visualize it and that's just this uh this kind of table um of of rectangles that we usually draw to represent our array so we use this little kind of chart to um to visualize this and again we've got these variables that are grouped together and each one can hold a piece of data so in this case each one can hold a name and we're going to refer to each one of those spots in the array as an element and so the rules here are that um each element has to be the same data type right so I can make an array of cans I can make an array of bottles I can make an array of loaves of bread but I can't have an array that has some cans some bottles and some loaves of bread right we have to determine that um the time it's created the other thing we have to determine at the time we create our array is how many elements there are and this is just because the the programming language um is going to you know your computer is going to go out and reserve a chunk of memory for this array and it needs to know how much space it's going to need that's determined by the data type and the number of elements so you have to set up all of that when you first create your array so this array has six elements each um each one is a name we probably going to think of that as like a string right and our identifier here team refers to the whole array not to an individual variable within that array so we need a naming convention we need a way to to refer to those individual uh elements in the array and we use index numbers for that so um these index numbers they're going to start at zero and um they're going to count up from there and what this means is that if I refer to uh the team array index 2 that in this case is Danielle right if I refer to team index 4 that's Javier all right so that's the the way that we can organize this data and refer to the individual elements within it and the total number of elements in our array is what we call the array length so in this case our array holds the names of six different team members that means it is a an array with a length of six there's an important relationship between the index numbers and that length and this is true in almost every single programming language there are a couple oddballs out there but certainly any that you're going to deal with in my classes um the lowest index number in an array is always going to be zero because that's where we start counting and the highest index number in other words the last element in the array is always going to be the length minus one so if the array's length is six the highest or last index is five this is something that is of I don't say confusing to beginners it's not a hard concept but it's really easy to confuse when you're writing code so what this means is that team index zero is valid team index 3 is valid for example team index 5 is valid but if I try and refer to team index 6 that's a problem because there is no such thing in this particular array so we always have to be aware of the length of our array and where those limits are for the the indexing now the next rule when we're working with arrays or the next important concept that we need to understand is that arrays are immutable now the word immutable means you can't change it in the case of arrays we mean that in kind of a specific way so we can change the contents of an array and by that what I mean is that um these individual elements we can change the value that is in those elements if I have Jesse that wants to be part of the team uh and is going to replace Danielle who's injured I can do that okay I can make that kind of a change to the values stored in the array but I can't for example change the data type I can't all of a sudden put in a frog instead of a person for example I I don't know why I picked that um that example but um the data type in this case holds the name of a person so that's what I have to put in there those kinds of changes are okay the kinds of changes that aren't okay are changes to the array structure itself so if I have a player named Isaiah I can't add Isaiah onto this team by just adding another element once I have created the element the excuse me once I've created the array it it has reserved memory for that exact size I can't just decide I now want to make it bigger or smaller for that matter there are some tricks we can do I mean it's not a hopeless situation um what I can do is I can make a new array that's bigger I can make a new array that holds one more person I can copy all the old data into that array I can put the new piece of data into that um that extra element at the end and then I can change where my identifier name team in this case points so that it now refers to this new array and if you're using a managed language like Java or C or something it will then um kind of get rid of that old uh array and free up the data so this can give us the illusion that an array can be changed but it's actually a pretty involved process this is something that we would refer to in programming as an expensive process meaning it takes some computing power to do that and that's just the nature of arrays if you're going to be working with a collection of data that's going to need to change a lot let's like let's say you need to keep track of your little sister's friends and there always there's always all kinds of drama they're fighting with each other and and somebody's kicked out of the group and somebody else is brought back in uh and you're going to have to be constantly changing the size of this array and moving things around then an array probably isn't the best choice you're probably going to want to use use something like a linked list or one of those other data structures that are way beyond our uh our scope here but there are options out there the last thing I want to mention is the close relationship between arrays and Loops an array by itself is really useful and really handy to have around it can save us from making a whole bunch of different variables and we can just make one but what really unlocks their potential is when you start using Loops to process them uh the most common type of loop that certainly that we'll use when you're working with me is what I call a traversal Loop and so a traversal Loop is when we just want to go through the entire array um so we're going to go through and just do something with each element it could mean that we're going to just output the name uh of each person on the team kind of create a roster uh if it's a bunch of numbers we could be going through and and adding them up something like that but a traversal Loop is a loop where we're going to start at zero we're going to end at length minus one and we're going to increment for each iteration doing something to The Loop and uh you'll see how to write these kinds of loops and you will write so many of them that they will become second major so arrays are going to give us our first chance to deal with collections of data or bigger amounts of data which is really what computers are so great at and and what really makes them so powerful at this point you are now ready to go off and start writing some code using arrays which we will take on in a separate video
