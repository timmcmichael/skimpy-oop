we're going to take a look at how arrays work in the Java programming language now I'm assuming by now that you already understand what arrays are in a general sense so if you don't if you haven't watched it yet go watch the video that is an introduction to arrays the other thing to be aware of is that pretty much every programming language has arrays going back to the earliest programming languages that were ever invented so whatever you're using probably has arrays in some form but it might be a little different than Java Java uses the C based syntax so in other words Java in general is based on the C programming language so there's a good chance that whatever language you're using is close to this but if you're not using Java you should probably go find a resource that is specific to your language with that all that said let's go ahead and jump into vs code and try this out in Java in that first video I used this example Le of a team where we want to keep track of the names of a handful of players you know six or seven players and I've started to write some code to do that without arrays and so uh the first player is John and now if I want to keep track of another name I have to make a new string variable for that so that's player two and that's Marie and if you're just working with a a small number of d a small number of strings in this case just a handful of pieces of data then doing it with individual variables is not that big a deal you know if it's a if it's a pickle ball team or something like that no big deal but what if it's a football team and now we have at least 22 variables that we going to have to keep track of and maybe even more than that if we have Subs things like that very quickly this starts to get unwieldy right it starts to become a real pain to deal with all these separate variables and that's where arrays come in so if I want to declare an array an array is a variable just like in anything else and so if it's an array of strings in this case I'm going to start out by saying string and now I need an identifier so the identifier or the name of this variable should reflect that it's really plural so if we're going to have you know if we're going to go from player to a group of players then players is probably a good name for that um and that we often use that for our our array names as just adding s onto whatever we're keeping track of um but team is also good because it's the idea of a of a group of players as well and it makes it clear in my code that when I refer to team I'm talking about the whole group not just an individual so this creates a string called team that's what we've been doing all along if we want to make this a variable the syntax that we add are these square brackets and we have to start being careful now because we've got curly braces for code blocks we've got parentheses for methods and and now we're adding on these square brackets which are um kind of above your return or enter key on the top right part of your keyboard that uh is always going to represent or refer to an array in the Java programming language so anytime you see square brackets we're talking about an array now what's interesting here is this sort of looks familiar it's a little bit of deja vu because I've got a similar chunk of code right here our main meth method where we begin our sort of entry point for a for a Java program takes as an argument an array of strings the reason for that has to do with command line arguments and we're not going to get into that here but I just want to point out that oh okay we've seen this before now we're starting to to understand the rest of this you know this first line of code we ever wrote that's a big pain in the neck so uh the square brackets in this case indicate that team is going going to be an array of strings and this one this line of code really just declares that variable and doesn't do anything with it it just sort of identifies the name to make this useful uh we really have to specify the size and so we're going to use an assignment statement in Java arrays are objects and so whenever we make a new object in Java we have to use the keyword new and so we're going to say say what do we want we want a new string array that holds and then we've got those brackets again but inside those this second set of brackets that's where we put the length of the array in other words the number of elements we want to have and so I've got on my team here 1 two 3 four five six my length is six that means I'm going to put six right there okay that line of code now is going to declare the name team as pointing to a an array of strings it's going to create that array of strings um big enough for six individual strings this array is not very useful at the moment because it's essentially empty it's it's filled with um with a bunch of you know empty strings essentially you're going to be null pointers in this case uh so to make it useful we got to start putting some some data into there the way that we refer to an individual element in an array is with this kind of subscript uh syn tax I'm going to say team and now my square brackets and inside the square brackets I put the element that I'm referring to and so if we look up here at my code comment we start numbering at zero 0 1 2 3 4 oops five I missed I missed my cursor there but I counted correctly um remember that the last element is always the length of the array minus one so the the length here is six that's what I specified that means my valid index numbers are going to go from zero to to five so let's say team Z team index0 equals John say team index one equals Marie oops I got to put that in quotation marks marine and then before we get too far let's just test that and see how this works so I'm going to say system out crint line team zero system out print line team one fix my typo and let's go ahead and run this so John and Marie this code works but it's turning me into a liar I said the whole point of this was to not have to deal with these variables individually and that's where we're headed with arrays but we have to get there first and so you got to you got to trust me for a few minutes here until we get to that point um but I want to pause to talk about this idea of accessing arrays uh with these index numbers so remember the valid indexes go from Zer to the length minus one which is five in this case and those index numbers can refer to any of those elements if I refer to for example three it's hard to remember this when you're first starting out that's not the third element in the array because we started at zero so 0 1 2 three that's actually the fourth one so if I run that I should get de oh I don't get de because I didn't assign anything to element number three so when we declare an array of objects and a string is an object until we put something there we get something that in Java is called a null pointer so it just says the word null null meaning kind of nothingness right so if I want to refer to element three I've got to assign that now I don't want to spend time assigning all these right now um because what I really want to show is what if we try to do what a lot of students do and say well I want the last one I want the last name in there that's there are six so that must be element six let's try that we have gotten an error it is an exception we call these errors exceptions in Java array index out of bounds exception so the boundaries I keep repeating it because it's important the boundaries for these index numbers are zero and the length minus one if I try and refer to an index outside of that range that's out of bounds the program is going to Well for now it's going to crash we'll learn later in our programming lives how to how to gracefully deal with that but for now we just crash our program and we grind to a halt so it's really important to use these index numbers carefully and to be aware of whether or not you are in bounds as long as I'm in bounds then these array elements are really just in this case string variables whatever your variable your data type is in your array so this team index zero is really the same as player one was in my old version and I can use it the same way so anything I could do with the variable player one I could now do with Team index zero so I can print it out we've seen that I can change it with an assignment statement and that works just fine so I'm trying to drive home the point here that once we have got some data in once we've created this array the individual elements in that array are just variables and there we don't you might not know them yet but there are a whole bunch of of um string related methods and things we can do with strings that um that I can do with with this team index zero team index one any valid index uh so we need to learn that this is really just a way of grouping individual variables together and those individual variables are still usable as variables all right but Tim come on you said the whole point of this was to make our lives easier this is actually worse because player one is probably easier to type than Team Bracket zero bracket right so this is just making things much worse uh let's go ahead and comment out this code and we'll show you the first shortcut you're going to learn with arrays and that is something that we call an initialization list so if we know what data we want to put into our array at the time we are Crea creating it we can just list that data and it will add that in at uh the time the program is executed so I can say I have to start over I've commented out my my my team array so it doesn't exist anymore that's why I've got an error here so let's recreate that string team equals now if I'm going to use an initializer list I don't use the new keyword instead I give it a block of code with curly braces and I can just list my elements in uh with a comma separated list inside of this initializer initialization so Marie it's hard for me to type and talk at the same time but I want to get all these names vessa and I need a semicolon at the end because this is a regular statement and now if I run this code okay John and Marie and that seems to be working fine and now I think before I tried to access the's index and he wasn't in the array yet so let's try that again there we go so this is our first shortcut with an array you can see that now we are starting to potentially save some time and some effort um using this initialization list now a couple things about this first of all you can only use an initialization list when you first create the array so I can't make an array uh called team and then use it for a little while and then go back and use an initialization list uh it is intended to be used it's allowed to be used only when you are creating the array for the first time so that's important to know uh what that means is that you can't make your array with an initialization list unless you know at the time you're making the array what all those values are so in other words for example if you're getting the values from the user they're typing them in you can't use an initialization list right so we'll have some different tricks for that the other thing I wanted to make clear here is that the only reason these are in par excuse me quotation marks is because this array happens to be an array of string objects right so the the quotation marks are related to these being strings if we see an example of an array of a different data type like a double uh we'll make an array of prices and I'm going to use an initialization list um I just write the doubles as I normally would write [Music] them semicolon at the end and that works just fine right but do not put quotation marks around them because now it's going to think they're strings and that doesn't work I cannot put a string into an array of doubles and vice versa once you declare the data type just like you would with any other variable uh you're locked into that and you can only use that kind of data with your array let me go ahead and fix that back to something that compiles now I'm going to say again that I'm going to drive home this point once again that once we have put a value into an array we can deal with that that element just like any other variable and I keep saying that because there seems to be sometimes a little tripping point for beginning programmers where they just make arrays more confusing than they need to be once you've put something in that array I mean you've been working with strings and doubles all along this is no different you're just it's got this funny little syntax with the square brackets so if I want to print out the prices I'm going to change that to prices and now three you might have noticed already is not going to work right because 01 two the highest valid index is two let's go ahe and just print out that first one okay $1.99 makes sense and if I want to manipulate that variable at all that excuse me see now I'm even calling them variables but um that array element I can do that so let's just say um prices zero plus equals 50 cents right inflation we're going to add 50 cents onto our price so try not to make these arrays more complicated than they need to be once something is in the array this is just a double in this case right these are just strings and I can use them the same way that I've been using doubles and strings all along right so I I know I'm repetitive but that really seems to be a stumbling block for students where they get something into an array and all of a sudden their brain hangs up on you know it's an array now it's hard to work with no they're just variables once they're um put into an array it's just like binding all those variables together all right and one last point I don't want to go through and demonstrate them all because it would it would never finish but I can make my arrays out of any uh any data type I want so I could make an array of ints I can make an array of characters I can make an array of um booleans um and then I can make an array of objects and so we've actually already done that with strings but with any object and so in a separate video we will explore that uh that idea but for now this is the basic Syntax for an array and in fact this is a really good place to stop this video because I want you to take arrays in really small um easily digested pieces here so what I would encourage you to do is stop at this point and just go try experimenting with these make some arrays put some data in it um manipulate that data get used to the idea that these really are just variables that are bundled together if you have any questions you can obviously reach out to me and once you have the hang of that you can move on to the next video
