I have one more trick up my sleeve with loops and arrays in Java and that is what I call the for each Loop there are a lot of people who also call it an enhanced for loop I think that's what it was originally called by the Java development team when they added it to the language but I think a lot of people call it a four each Loop it gives us another way to iterate through an array or or other kinds of collections when we know what those are and and it um eliminates the need for us to worry about index numbers or going out of bounds or any of that kind of stuff because it handles it all for us it's optional you anything you can do with a a 4 each Loop you can do with a traditional four loop as well and often it's not very useful to us because it's very limited in how it works but when you do need just a really basic um front to back traversal it gives us a nice easy syntax and we don't have to worry about going out of bounds anything so I'm assuming here that you already know how to work with loops and arrays um and how to make arrays of objects as well and if not you can go view those videos otherwise we will jump in so I've started with two basic arrays here one is an array of the dog class and so you can download that code from canvas it's from a previous video and uh and then I've also got just a double array with some prices in it and we want to have an an example with objects and then an example of an array with Primitives and we're going to start by just a basic traversal as we've been doing in in other videos where we want to Output everything that is in the array so the for each syntax is going to be really simple inside the parentheses here for the force statement I'm going to essentially declare a variable of the same data type as my array so I'm going to do the dogs array first the dog's array has objects from the dog class I'm going to create a dog um variable called D um and then you put a colon the two dots and the name of the array that you want to Traverse and so my array is called dogs and the way this works is that every iteration the variable D is going to be equal to the current dog in the array so in other words the first iteration D is going to be Fifi and then the next iteration it's going to be phto and then Rover and then Spike and then it's going to know that we're done with the array and it's going to stop so there's none of this start at zero end at length minus one kind of stuff it just um works and handles the the array boundaries so let's go system out print line now the difference here when we work with this within the iteration is that the other difference is that I don't need that bracket syntax because inside this Loop body I'm not dealing with an array anymore I'm dealing with a dog object so I just can say dog. get name and I'll make it print out the dog's name and age plus d. getage and let's go ahead and run this and see if it works all right and it does just like that I have created a a traversal that out an output traversal as I called it in another video that just prints out um every every dog in the dog's array and that's all it took was just those those couple of lines of code and again the idea is within that Loop body I'm dealing with just a good oldfashioned dog object or whatever other class we're using for our array and I can do anything with it that I can do with a normal dog so uh I'm going to make I could do this within the same Loop but it's fun to make these and we're trying to learn how to do it so I'm going to just do one again and say four so the way the reason we call it a four each Loop is the way that we would read that out is for each dog D in dogs and then our Loop so that's where the name four each comes from and uh what I'll do this time is I'm going to have the dog have a birthday there's a method called have a birthday that as you could probably guess adds one to their age now I could put this in the same loop I don't it's not like the loop is limited to one line of code so in fact after they have a birthday let's go ahead and print them out again right there and I'm going to print a little divider just so that visually I got confused in one of those other videos I don't want to have that happen again oops I can't type either just a little dividing line so that I can tell which Loop is which in my output so let's try that one all right so um the first time through which is just the output um there are the dogs and their ages then the next the next Loop um the next traversal we have a birthday for each dog and then we print them out again and we can see that their age has has increased by one um for each dog now this is great right this is a nice easy syntax much easier than remembering how to do a a regular for Loop if you're a new programmer so why on Earth would we ever use that old kind of for Loop when we could just use this there are a couple reasons one is that this type of enhanced for Loop or for each Loop can only do a start to end traversal what I would call like a standard traversal it's going to start at index zero it's going to go through each array element in order until it gets to the last element in the array in other words I can't go backwards I can't skip some I can't do anything unusual it's just a front to back traversal that may or may not be a big deal um there are sometimes when we want to move through an array backwards or in some different way the other common reason why we might not use a for each Loop in any um given circumstance is that notice there's no counter variable here there's no this isn't a counter controlled Loop and so that's fine if all we're doing is printing out the um the elements or something like that but sometimes we need that Index right if we're doing a search and I want to search through the array and um and check where an object is or where a value is in that array and then end up with that index number so I can do something else with it later I can't do that here right there is no you know I for example so you know what's funny is I sometimes have students that do something like this they'll create a variable called I and then in here they'll say i++ I guess there's nothing wrong with that um but it seems sort of silly if you need an if you need a a counter like that then just do a regular for Loop so I don't particularly like that but but that is another reason why we might not use a 4 each Loop is because we don't end up with that counter now we still can have an accumulator if we want right I could declare I want to add up the dog's ages I could make a variable um called sum or total age or something and I could add to it within this loop as an accumulator and then after the loop is done I would have the total age of all of the dogs so it that doesn't prevent everything that we might do but but that is a pretty big limitation to um to only be able to go through it in One Direction and to only be able to do it without having a uh a counter it does work essentially the same way if we want to do this with a primitive data type like double or int or any of those those other Primitives for each double P or I'll say double price in prices okay and that's I like the way that reads for each double price in the array prices um again I can just say system out print line and I can print out price and that's going to just print that value out I could also um you know if I could also do some math with it I could um I could say double total I'll do an accumulator like I was just talking about equals 0.0 and I could add on to that I could say total plus equals price and now at the end of that I can print out the total and try that see if I've made any mistakes it looks good um you saw in the other video the other you know we could add a dollar to each one or something like that but that is the basic um syntax and usage for a for each Loop or what some people call an enhanced for for Loop really really useful you can't use it all the time but it's um it's a nice um it's one of those nice to know things not a need to know things right you can you can program without it but um now that you know how easy it is you'll probably want to use this a little bit too I do need to caution you you got to make sure that you use whatever Loop is specified by my assignment if you're turning in an assignment for my class because I do consider four each to be optional and I don't want you using it on assignments until you've shown me that you can use traditional for Loops first so keep that in mind but if you have any questions about for each Loops Reach Out
