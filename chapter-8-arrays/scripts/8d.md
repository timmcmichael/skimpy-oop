one thing that comes up with arrays that just seems to throw new programmers for a little bit of a loop if you'll pardon that pun is when we ask you to create an array that holds objects and it turns out you've been doing this all along because in Java strings are objects and I think we've you've probably been creating arrays of strings all along but uh but when it comes to designing a class of your own and making an array that holds objects of that type um there's something about that that students sort of have trouble understanding how to interact with those objects within the array so that's what we're going to take a look at here now I'm assuming that you already know what arrays are and a basic understanding of what what they do um that you can use arrays on a basic level and that you can write Loops to do things like traversals if you don't know all of that stuff you need to stop here and go watch those videos um but once you are back from doing that then we'll jump in and write some code I'm going to be using this dog class that I literally just wrote right before I hit record and is probably filled with errors that I will discover as we go but the idea here is I want to create an array that holds dog objects okay it's the same basic concept no matter what kind of object we're working with so I am going to um create create a dog array all dogs there's new dog three okay now no matter how we cut this no matter how we do this we're going to have some typing to do so I can only save you so much typing with our array tricks but let's see kind of both ways we can do this um so this is the the first way we learned to deal with arrays I'm going to say dogs index zero equals new dog now I have to call that Constructor and the Constructor it says we need a name phto and we need to know the dog's age I'm GNA say that phto is four and now dogs one dog one dogs index one is new dog over and over is two and dog two is going to be new dog with the name Spike and Spike is going to be eight okay so I have now created uh an array of dogs and I have put dogs into it and again the idea is that students sometimes think that there's some trick here but look what we did this is no different than saying dog D1 equals new dog P okay page four it's the same thing in fact I'm G to move this up here above so it's kind of out of the way um it's the same thing it's just another object these are just additional instances of the dog class the only difference is we're putting them into an array instead of a dog array uh dog variable so to speak uh let's go ahead and do a quick traversal here to see if that uh if that works correctly and I'm going to pause the video for this and through the magic of video technology I have typed a quick little traversal here and let's run this and see what we get ah so we're back to that idea that when we print just an object we don't get any information from inside the object but we have some getter methods that will let me have access to that stuff I've got get name get age check the smell um I can call those the same way I would call it on a regular variable right so if I wanted to um if I wanted to print out d1's name I would just say D1 do get name well it's going to be the same thing except instead of D1 I'm going to say dogs Index i.get right delete that L code that I don't really need uh but again trying to emphasize this potentially confusing idea that these are just dog objects now that we happen to have put into a an array and we just use this slightly different syntax to manipulate them or to work with them so far so good uh let's take a quick look at how we created this array though uh because like I said there's a lot of typing and there's we can't really do much about that you have to provide the information that's necessary to to instantiate these dogs um but there are a couple other things to be aware of here one of them is if I make that bigger I can assign a dog object and exist exting dog object to our array so I remember I created Fifi up here and just put Fifi into a variable called D1 I can add D1 to the array because it's the right data type right it's a dog and so now when we Traverse we should see Fifi's name on there as well it didn't save us any time but it is something that comes up every once a while you have an object already let's put it into an array but the one you might be wondering about is okay how about that initialization list does that that save us any work it does save us a little bit um but it is potentially confusing the way the syntax Works let's comment out all of that and let's try this with an initialization list so I'm going to say dog dogs equals we've got this list now I'll put the semicolon before I forget it I can put for example an existing dog object I could put Fifi in there right as part of my ization list and there's Fifi but I can also just put new instantiations in there so I can just take a an instantiation statement new dog phto new dog Rover and I'll stop there because I'm running out of space on my screen here as I try and show different things so I can still use that initialization but I can't get around calling the using the word new and calling that dog Constructor to create those dogs and then just one last demonstration of this idea of using these just as very just like you would use any other objects is let's um say we want to have phto play outside and playing outside makes the dog not smell good that's what that method does so it's the same thing we've been doing but just trying to through repetition trying to emphasize that so that's going to be the index is 0 one is phto so index one is phto dot play outside and even Visual Studio code recognizes that this is just a dog object so the kind of intellisense they call it the auto correct feature offers that as a as a potential solution system. out. print line dogs one dot get what I oh I was G I didn't did I make a getter for that oh check smell I called it because they being weird with my names check smell and um check smell returns a string and says phyto stinks if I didn't have him play outside and I run it then he smells clean so I it's just another example of how you know don't let the fact that we've put these objects into an array don't let that throw you off you're still just working with objects the only thing that's different is this array syntax we're going to create an array based on that dog data type that dog class and then we're going to populate it with instantiated dog objects there really isn't anything else to say about the idea of using arrays of objects I guess you know it could never end right I another thing I could show you is how do you make an a class an object that has an array as one of its Fields as one of its instance variables um I'm not going to ask you to do that in um cis1 15ab which is where what I'm recording this video for so I'm not going to get into that here but um the idea is we're just trying to emphasize that these arrays are really just variables or objects that are bundled together into a data structure and if we use that square bracket syntax we can access them and work with them just like any other object or variable if you have any questions about that go ahead and reach out 

# Summary

Are you ready to unleash your coding skills and embark on a paw-some journey with arrays in Java? In this video, we'll dive into the tail-wagging world of arrays that hold objects, specifically focusing on our furry friends in the Dog class. Don't let the idea of arrays throw you off your leash; it's not as ruff as it seems! We'll fetch some knowledge on how to create, traverse, and manipulate arrays of objects, ensuring you won't be barking up the wrong tree. So, let's paws for a moment and get ready to dig into some code!

The video explains the concept of creating and using arrays that hold objects in Java, specifically focusing on a custom Dog class. It highlights common challenges new programmers face when dealing with arrays of objects and emphasizes that arrays of objects are similar to arrays of primitive types. The video demonstrates how to instantiate objects and add them to an array, perform traversals, and use getter methods to access object properties. It also covers initialization lists and the importance of understanding array syntax to manipulate objects effectively.
