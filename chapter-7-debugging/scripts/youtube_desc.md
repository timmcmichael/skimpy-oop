# 7A - Intro to Debugging

It takes a humble man to admit that his code is not perfect. I am not a humble man. I mean, sometimes someone else must get into my code and make a mess of it--that's the only explanation. 

This video is here to get you pumped up about debugging. Learn a little debugging trivia to astound your friends and family. Learn about the different types of bugs. Learn some strategies to tracking down those bugs and setting the world right.

0:00 Intro (and "bug" trivia!)
1:52 Types of Bugs
7:30 A "Debugging Mindset"
11:09 Debugging Tips
22:07 Outro

# 7B - Debugging Java in VS Code

It turns out that there are a bunch of tools in VS Code that can help you track down bugs in your code. All this time, while you've been smashing your head against your keyboard, I've been sipping margaritas and quickly debugging my code like a ninja.

Don't worry, grasshopper. It's time for you to dig into those debugging tools and learn some more efficient ways to see what's happening in your code and identify bugs. We'll look at setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and examining variable values.

# 7C - Intro to GitHub Copilot in VS Code

If an artificial intelligence ever asks, "shall we play a game?" the answer is always "no." Just ask Ferris Bueller. But what if an AI offers to help you write code? As Ferris would say, "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." So, it's time to stop and look around at some of these fancy schmancy AI tools everyone is so excited about.

We're going to check out the GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio Code. We'll see how it can offer AI-powered code suggestions, or write code based on natural language prompts. We'll even sneak in some thoughts about ethical use of AI. After all, we don't want to accidentally start a global thermo-nuclear war. This is a Wargame, it's a YouTube video...

1:46 Installing GitHub Copilot
2:54 AI Code Suggestions
5:59 Copilot chatbot
7:14 Turning Off Code Suggestions
7:44 Code Completion with a Web-based AI
8:58 Cheating Concerns with Copilot
