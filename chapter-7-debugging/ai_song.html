    <h1>Java Programming Song</h1>
    <p>The following song was created by Copilot in response to the prompt, "Write a song about java programming in the style of Chuck Berry"</p>
    <h2>(Verse 1)</h2>
    <p>Well, I got my laptop, and I'm ready to code,<br>
    Gonna write some Java, hit the open road.<br>
    With my IDE open, and my fingers flyin' fast,<br>
    Gonna make a program that's built to last.</p>

    <h2>(Chorus)</h2>
    <p>Java rockin' all night long,<br>
    With loops and classes, you can't go wrong.<br>
    From the first line to the final compile,<br>
    Java programming, it's got that style.</p>

    <h2>(Verse 2)</h2>
    <p>Got my <code>public static void main</code>, it's the start of the show,<br>
    With variables and methods, watch 'em grow.<br>
    I'll debug and refactor, make it clean and neat,<br>
    Java's got the rhythm, can't be beat.</p>

    <h2>(Chorus)</h2>
    <p>Java rockin' all night long,<br>
    With loops and classes, you can't go wrong.<br>
    From the first line to the final compile,<br>
    Java programming, it's got that style.</p>

    <h2>(Bridge)</h2>
    <p>Now I'm swingin' with Swing, and dancin' with threads,<br>
    Handling exceptions, no more dread.<br>
    From arrays to collections, I'm in the groove,<br>
    Java's got the power, makes me move.</p>

    <h2>(Chorus)</h2>
    <p>Java rockin' all night long,<br>
    With loops and classes, you can't go wrong.<br>
    From the first line to the final compile,<br>
    Java programming, it's got that style.</p>

    <h2>(Outro)</h2>
    <p>So if you're lookin' for a language that's cool and slick,<br>
    Java's the one that'll do the trick.<br>
    With a rock 'n' roll heart and a programmer's soul,<br>
    Java's the beat that'll make you whole.</p>
