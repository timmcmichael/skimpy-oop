A computer is designed to execute a series of instructions, in order, very quickly. 
Now that we understand how to use Boolean expressions to control the flow of our programs, we can use that concept for a programming structure that really unlocks the power of the computer: repetition.
Many of the tasks we think of as "computer tasks" are repetitive in nature.
Processing data involve performing the same operation on each piece of information, one after the other, until we reach the end of the data.
A computer game has to draw the screen, check for collisions, check what the user is doing with the gamepad, and update the positions of all the objects on the screen, over and over again.
When you use a search engine on the web, that search engine has scanned the web one page at a time, indexing what it finds and then moving on to the next page.

Computers are great for these kinds of tasks: they don't get bored, they don't get tired, and they don't make mistakes--other than the mistakes we make when programming them!

To create the kind of repetition that leverages this processing power, programmer use _loops_.
A loop is a structure that repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
Each time the loop repeats, it's called an _iteration_.

Java provides several different ways to create loops and iterate over a block of code.

=== Defininte vs Indefinite Loops
Loops fall into two broad categories: definite and indefinite.

A _definite loop_ is one that repeats a specific number of times. 
At the time the loop starts, it has already been determined exactly how many times it will repeat.
The _programmer_ might not know at the time of writing the program--for example, if the number of times the loop repeats is based on user input--but the condition that determines how many times the loop will repeat is known before the loop starts.

And example of a definite loop a loop that prints out the name of every student on a roster. 
The program checks the number of students on the roster, and that count is the number of times the loop will repeat.
Definite loops are also called _counter controlled loops_ because the programmer uses a counter variable to keep track of how many times the loop has repeated.

An _indefinite loop_ is one that repeats until a certain condition is met.
It can't be known how many times the loop will repeat until it's actually running.
The loop begins it's first iteration, and the condition that determines whether the loop will repeat is checked.
That condition might be based on user input, the state of the program, or some other factor that can't be determined until the program is running.

An example of an indefinite loop is a prompt that asks the user to input their password, and keeps repeating until the user's input is correct.
The user might input the correct password the first time, it might take 3 tries, or it might take 100 tries.
The program doesn't know and is just going to repeat until the user gets it right.
This type of loop is sometimes called a _sentinel controlled loop_ because the loop repeats until a "sentinel" value is encountered--a signal that the loop should stop.

Any of the Java loop structures can be used to create either a definite or an indefinite loop.
However, some of the loop structures are better suited to one type of loop or the other, so it's good to think about what kind of loop you need before you start writing your code.

=== `while` Loops
==== #This section is not finished, but in the meantime this content is covered in section 6.2 (page 202) in the textbook.#

The first structure Java provides for creating loops is the `while` loop.
The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
The condition is checked before the block of code is executed, so the block of code might not execute at all if the condition is false the first time it's checked.

A `while` loop is exactly like an `if` statement: a Boolean expression is checked, and if it's true, the block of code is executed.
The only difference is that, after the block of code is executed, the program jumps back to the beginning of the loop and checks the condition again.
If the condition is still true, the block of code is executed again.

.Example of a `while` loop
[source,java]
----
int count = 0;
while (count < 10) {
    System.out.println("Count is: " + count);
    count++;
}
----

In this example, the Boolean expression `count < 10` is checked; if it's true, the block of code is executed.
The block of code prints out the value of `count`, then increments `count` by 1.
The program then jumps back to the beginning of the loop and checks the condition again.
This process repeats until the expression `count < 10` is false.

The result of this loop is that the program prints out the value of `count` 10 times, starting with 0 and ending with 9.
It is a definite loop because, before the loop staarts, it's already known that the loop will repeat 10 times.

==== Infinite Loops
One thing to be careful of when using a `while` loop is the possibility of creating an _infinite loop_.
An infinite loop is a loop that repeats forever, because the condition that determines whether the loop should repeat is never false.
Infinite loops are a common mistake for new programmers, and they can cause your program to hang or crash.

.Example of an infinite loop
[source,java]
----
int count = 0;
while (count < 10) {
    System.out.println("Count is: " + count);
}
----

In this example, we've forgotten to increment `count` by 1 after printing it out.
`count` will always be `0`, so the condition `count < 10` will always be true.
The program will print out "Count is: 0" over and over again, forever.

NOTE: Your IDE will have a way to stop the program if it's stuck in an infinite loop. Often, this is a square button--essentially the symbol for "stop". In VS Code, you can also kill the terminal window that's running the program by clicking the trash can icon in the terminal window. Finally, in many cases you can press `Ctrl+C` to stop the program.

The simplest infinite loop you can create in Java is:

[source,java]
----
while (true) { 
    // hey, there's nothing to stop this loop!
}
----

This loop will repeat forever, because the condition `true` is always true.
Some programmers use this to start a loop and then use an if statement to break out of the loop when a certain condition is met, but that's not really an infinite loop--it just puts the boolean expression that controls the loop in an `if` statement instead of the `while` statement. 
I personally consider it less readable than using a clear condition in the `while` statement, so I don't write loops like that.

=== `do-while` Loops
==== #The videos for this section are not finished, but in the meantime this content is covered in section 6.5 (page 217) in the textbook.#
As we've seen, a `while` loop checks the condition before executing the block of code.
A `do-while` loop is similar, but it checks the condition after executing the block of code.
This means that the block of code will always execute at least once, even if the condition is false the first time it's checked.
Other than that, a `do-while` loop is exactly the same as a `while` loop.

.Example of a `do-while` loop
[source,java]
----
int count = 0;
do {
    System.out.println("Count is: " + count);
    count++;
} while (count < 10);
----

This is the same loop as the `while` loop we looked at earlier, but the condition is checked after the block of code is executed.
The `while` statement is at the end of the loop; the `do` statement at the beginning indicates the block of code that should iterate.

==== Choosing Between `while` and `do-while` Loops
Both `while` and `do-while` loops work well for _indefinite loops_ (though they can be used for definite loops as well).
There's nothing in the structure of these loops that requires a counter or other control variable, so they can be used for loops that repeat until a certain condition is met.

In many cases, it doesn't matter whether you use a `while` or a `do-while` loop.
They're functionally equivalent, and you can use either one to create the same loop.
However, in some cases, one might be a better choice than the other.
If you need to guarantee that the block of code will execute at least once, you should use a `do-while` loop.
