# 6A - Intro to Loops

Look, you can have your roller coasters and drop towers. You know what theme park ride everyone loves? A merry-go-round, of course. But you know what theme park ride everyone hates? A merry-go-round that never stops. If you're going to do something over and over again, you gotta know when to say "when."

In this video, you'll learn the value of restraint as we talk about repetition in programming. We'll introduce the concept of loops, which are structures that let you repeat a block of code multiple times. Definite loops, indefinite loops, check-first, or run-first--we'll cover it all. The possibilities are infinite, but our loops won't be.

# 6B - while Loops in Java

It's been a while since I first learned about loops. In fact, it would have been back in the 1980s, when music could really throw you for a loop: "Round and Round" by Ratt, "Here I Go Again" by Whitesnake, "Time After Time" by Cyndi Lauper. But we're not here to keep repeating our time in the fabulous 80s.

In this video, we'll talk about the while loop: definite, indefinite, and everything in between. Well, there is no in between, so really just those two. The examples here are meant to align to the assignments so those don't throw you for a loop.

# 6C - do-while Loops in Java

Even at my age, my mom's always ordering me around. "Do this, do that." But I'm a grown man and I'll do what I want. I mean, as long as it's okay with my wife. But when it comes to coding, I really AM the boss and get to tell the computer what to do.

It's time to learn the do-while loop, which is a variation of the while loop. Check yourself before you wreck yourself, and check your condition before you run your block. In fact, check the user's input while you're at it, which is a good use of a do-while loop. And maybe even learn a little trick with the printf() method.

# 5D - Nested if Statements

With our programs growing up so fast, making decisive and complex decisions, you might be starting to worry--what happens when your programs go out on their own? Will you end up an empty nester, with nothing but a few lines of code to remember them by?

This video will show you how to keep your nest full. Full of if statement, of course. We'll look at nested if statements, which are if statements inside of if statements. It's like a Russian nesting doll of decisions! And they let us make hierarchical decisions, where one decision depends on another.
