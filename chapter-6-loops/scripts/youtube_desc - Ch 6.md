# 6A - Intro to Loops

Look, you can have your roller coasters and drop towers. You know what theme park ride everyone loves? A merry-go-round, of course. But you know what theme park ride everyone hates? A merry-go-round that never stops. If you're going to do something over and over again, you gotta know when to say "when."

In this video, you'll learn the value of restraint as we talk about repetition in programming. We'll introduce the concept of loops, which are structures that let you repeat a block of code multiple times. Definite loops, indefinite loops, check-first, or run-first--we'll cover it all. The possibilities are infinite, but our loops won't be.

# 6B - while Loops in Java

It's been a while since I first learned about loops. In fact, it would have been back in the 1980s, when music could really throw you for a loop: "Round and Round" by Ratt, "Here I Go Again" by Whitesnake, "Time After Time" by Cyndi Lauper. But we're not here to keep repeating our time in the fabulous 80s.

In this video, we'll talk about the while loop: definite, indefinite, and everything in between. Well, there is no in between, so really just those two. The examples here are meant to align to the assignments so those don't throw you for a loop.

# 6C - do-while Loops in Java

Even at my age, my mom's always ordering me around. "Do this, do that." But I'm a grown man and I'll do what I want. I mean, as long as it's okay with my wife. But when it comes to coding, I really AM the boss and get to tell the computer what to do.

It's time to learn the do-while loop, which is a variation of the while loop. Check yourself before you wreck yourself, and check your condition before you run your block. In fact, check the user's input while you're at it, which is a good use of a do-while loop. And maybe even learn a little trick with the printf() method.

# 6D - `for` Loops in Java

You know how programmers are, always looking for a shortcut--always finding ways to type less. Java's got you covered! for statements are a definite improvement over while statements when you need to make a definite loop. Why write three separate lines of code when you can cram all that into one line?

See how to take the three components of a loop (initializing a variable, checking a condition, and changing the variable) and combine them all into a for loop. Count up, count down, count any way you like. And learn a thing or two about increment operators while you're at it.

# 6e - `break` and `continue` in Java

Some people are rule-followers and some are rule-breakers. If you're tired of my ridiculously overbearing rules, this video is your change to break free from the shackles that bind you. Or, you know, just break out of a loop.

In this video, I rant about how terrible you are if you use break and continue startments, then proceed to show you how to use them. Break out of a loop early, or skip the rest of the loop and start the next iteration. It's like a get-out-of-jail-free card for loops. Only, instead of passing go and collecting $200, you'll just drive your instructor crazy--and it's tough to put a price on that.
