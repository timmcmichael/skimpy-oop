When we learned about `if` statements, we added the ability to run different blocks of code based on a Boolean expression. We can also use a Boolean expression to run a block of code multiple times. This is called a loop.

There are a ton of reasons we use loops in programming. But as with many topics, we start out with some simple examples. As we learn more about programming, we'll see more and more situations where loops are useful.

Every loop can be categorized as either _definite_ or _indefinite_. A definite loop is one that runs a specific number of times. An indefinite loop is one that runs until a condition is met. Both types rely on a Boolean expression to determine when to stop.

There are different ways to write loops in Java, and we're going to start with the two that have the easiest syntax: `while` and `do-while`.
