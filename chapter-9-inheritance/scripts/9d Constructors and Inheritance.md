I want to talk about the way  Constructors work in an inheritance  situation because there are some special  behaviors that we have to be aware of  otherwise our code will not compile you  might have noticed that in my other  inheritance videos I've avoided using  any Constructors at all that's because  we hadn't gotten to this video yet in  order to make sense of this you do need  to understand how to extend a class and  you really need to understand how  overwriting works and that I idea of a  kind of an inheritance hierarchy that's  used for method calls but if you've  watched those let's go ahead and take a  look at  Constructors we'll use the bank account  and checking account classes that we  have been using up until now and we're  just going to ignore the other methods  here and we're just going to talk about  the  constructors recall that when you create  a class if you don't Define a  Constructor then the compiler is going  to create one for you it's just going to  take all the fields and set them to some  initial values like zero or a null  reference or something like that so I've  got those Constructors shown on my  diagram here even though we didn't write  the code for them now consider just the  sort of generic line of code we use to  create an object to instantiate an  object uh so checking account is the  class that we're dealing with uh we're  going to call it account one and then  we're going to use this new keyword with  checking account Constructor call and  again I haven't created The Constructor  but the compiler is doing that for me  now when we talk about overwriting we  had just gotten used to the idea that um  overwriting method calls take place from  the bottom of the hierarchy and work  their way up but with a Constructor it's  different a Constructor starts at the  top it starts with a superclass  Constructor and it has to run that  Constructor no matter what after it's  run the superclass Constructor then it's  going to go ahead and go on to any  subclass Constructors it finds all the  way down the inheritance tree let's go  ahe and take a look at and see how this  looks in Visual Studio code same old  bank account that we've been working  with and a checking account that extends  it the only changes I've made is I added  a new test file for it a new test  program because my old one was getting a  little bit cluttered and so this is just  called test Constructors and it's got a  main method with nothing in it uh let's  go ahead and create a checking account  object here checking  account account one equals new checking  account and again that's that default  Constructor call because I haven't  defined a Constructor of my  own and I will just print out the uh  we'll get the uh account number from  this so so system out print line count  one.get account number just so we have  something that I can test and make sure  things are  working so far so good again uh that's  that null reference that I mentioned a  moment ago uh since my default  Constructor doesn't know what else to  put in that uh in  that in these fields it just puts a null  reference there for that string and  let's go ahead and go over to the bank  account and create a Constructor so  public bank account and we won't have  any arguments here um people a lot of  people refer to this now as a default  Constructor and this is where I get  nitpicky it's no longer a default  Constructor because I wrote it so a  default Constructor really is what the  compiler makes but everybody calls this  a default Constructor since it uh  doesn't have any parameters or arguments  excuse me uh I'm going to not do  Constructor things with this here I'm  just going to have it print something  out so I'm going to say have it print  out bank  account  Constructor and then I am going to go to  the checking account and I'm going to  make basically the same  thing public checking  account another parameter list  Constructor  here and I'm going to say checking  account  Constructor save both of those come over  to my uh test Constructor program here  and give it a  shot sure enough it says bank account  Constructor first then it says checking  account Constructor then it says this no  pointer that's from part from our  account number here so this is just  confirming what we saw a moment ago that  unlike regular method calls a  Constructor call uh works from the top  down now where the potential problems  come in is when we talk about  Constructors that do have arguments and  so let's say I get rid of that that  parameterless Constructor that default  Constructor and now I've got one that  takes an account number which is a  string when I go to instantiate an  object at first this looks okay because  the checking account uh class does have  that parameterless Constructor still but  what happens is it comes in looking for  this Constructor in the bank account  first and it says well here's the only  Constructor I see and it requires some  information I don't have that  information so I can't do anything here  the solution here is that our  subclass Constructor needs to  specifically or explicitly call that  bank account Constructor and pass in the  information that's needed so let's go  take a look at how to do that okay so  let's go over to our bank account and  make this new Constructor so I'm going  to say  public bank account and this time it's  going to take a string I'll call it  account number like that and all it's  going to do is assign oops  assign account num equals that parameter  now I I in the interest of speed here  I'm not doing all the other variables  but I really should assigning values to  all those and now at this  point we're still okay my program should  still run just  fine because this quote unquote default  Constructor is still available the  problem is often we don't want or don't  need to create that that sort of default  Constructor there and so  now when I try and run  this I have a problem it might be hard  to see there but it's an uh it says  implicit super Constructor bank account  is  undefined uh it must explicitly invoke  another  Constructor so if the only Constructor I  have requires one or more um parameters  then this checking account class doesn't  compile because it doesn't deal with  that piece of information that's  missing so the idea  here is if your super class  requires parameters in order to create  an object the very first thing you have  to do in your subclass objects are call  is call that superclass Constructor so  remember we had that keyword super that  we used in our uh in our overwriting  video if we just put super with empty  parentheses that now refers to the  Constructor and in that parentheses I  can put um I'll put in just 1 two 3 four  five as my account  number that should now  compile and run  it so so we're going to kind of clarify  or add some Nuance to my description  before it's not that the bank that it  starts at the top and begins calling  Constructors from there it's that the  default Constructor of the subass is  really calling that default Constructor  of the super class first and it does  have to be the first thing so if I take  um if I take that line of  code and I put it at the bottom that  doesn't work it's going to say that it  must be the very first statement in the  Constructor  okay now I don't have  to use that sort of literal value that  constant value 1 2 3 4 5 I can for  example make a new Constructor that also  takes  a  parameter and I can just say super and  pass in that account  number and that should work as well and  so now I can create a bank account by  specifying that account number I'll just  say AB c d  e and if I run that that  works ABCDE  e now to be clear I've got two  Constructors here I don't need to have  both of them necessarily it's just a  question of which way you need to call  and create your objects but the takeaway  here is that if you have any requirement  that the super class Constructor has  parameters has gets some data and you  don't also provide a parameter list  Constructor then your subclasses have to  address that they have to use this super  keyword to call back and run that  Constructor in the super class before it  can go on and do anything else  it's a somewhat confusing concept at  first you get the hang of it pretty  quickly the error messages once you  start seeing them you'll go oh yeah I  forgot that I got to take care of that  um so it's it's not hard once you get  the hang of it but if you have any  trouble with it reach out and let me  know
