all right I am ready to take what we've  learned about the idea of inheritance  and try implementing that in Java by  extending our first class now I am going  to assume that you understand the basic  idea of inheritance and what it is and  you can watch the video that is an  introduction to inheritance if you  haven't done that yet in this video with  code that we write we're going to build  on one of the examples from that video  and we're going to implement a bank  account class and a couple of sub  classes based on that now we're gon to  not uh do the entire class diagram we're  not going to implement everything that  we used in that other video but just  enough to show you the idea so let's go  ahead and jump over to vs code and start  working on our class and to demonstrate  extending a class I've got a couple of  files that I'm going to work with here  and you can download these out of canvas  I've got first a very simple  implementation of that bank account  class from uh from the graphic there and  it is like I said very straightforward  it's got some Fields it's got some  Getters for those fields a couple of  Setters and then it has a deposit method  and a withdraw method and about the only  thing interesting uh with these two that  you might not expect is that the  withdraw method has some logic in it to  just make sure there's enough money  before it does the subtraction so it  checks to see if they have enough money  and then uh if it does it reduces the  balance and then it's going to return a  Boolean it's going to return a true or  false indicating whether or not the  withdrawal was  successful I also have a test program  for that and it's not a comprehensive  test it doesn't check everything in the  bank account class but it instantiates  an object it puts in 500 bucks now it's  going to try to withdraw 700 and output  an appropriate message whether or not  that succeeds and then because I know  that's really not going to succeed  there's not enough money I also then try  withdrawing  $150 with again a message um outputting  whether or not that is successful and  finally I'm going to Output the balance  at the end just to to make sure that  that worked so let's go ahead and run  this all right so it does fail to take  out $700 but then it successfully  withdraws 150 and when I check the  balance it leaves us with $350  the first thing I'm going to need to do  is I'm going to make a new Java file and  the convention in Java generally is  every time we have a new class we make a  new file I know that we don't  necessarily have to do it that way but  I'm going to stick with the convention  and the first subass I'm going to create  is going to be a checking account so I'm  going to call this checking account.  Java and visual studio code is going to  help me out by um putting in that class  statement and in order to implement this  idea of inheritance since the keyword in  Java is  extends so um we're going to extend the  checking account class or sorry the  checking account class is going to  extend the bank account class I started  to say that backwards if we were talking  about this we would say that we extend  the bank account uh to a checking  account but we're in checking account so  we are uh that is going to extend bank  account and in fact let's just stop  there and try that and see what what uh  how this works  back in my test program here I'm going  to comment out uh a bunch of that stuff  so that I don't get confused by it but I  might want it  later and I'm going to create a checking  account object so checking account I'll  call this checking one equals new  checking account and now I'm going to  just um uh try  depositing some money into that I'll put  in  $50.7 and now I'm going to print out the  balance and let's just run that even  though I haven't written really written  any code let's just see what  happens okay always hard to see in the  uh output window here uh but that does  work correctly let's go ahead and clean  up my workspace here a little bit and  the idea here is literally all I've done  is add that keyword extends and  indicated what class I am extending so  the rule that we say is a checking we  use the is a test right a checking  account is a bank account and so I can  use it just like a bank account in other  words it gets to inherit all of the um  the term we use as all the members uh  all of the variables and uh methods and  anything else that is part of that bank  account class automatically gets  inherited by checking account so without  even writing any additional code I'm  able to use that checking account now  let's start extending the functionality  of that bank account uh into what a  checking account can do and and what it  keeps track of so I'll start with some  my Fields here my instance  variables and the the idea here is I  don't need to indicate things like  balance and the owner's name because  we've already inherited that all I have  to add in this class is stuff that is  specific to a checking account so um  what we keep track of with a checking  account is I'm going to have an integer  for the last check number in other words  what's the most recent check that we've  written and uh we'll also keep track of  how many checks we have remaining  remaining this isn't um by the way the  most realistic or possibly useful uh  checking account class but I'm just  trying to keep the examples really  simple and it's going to be easy to use  integers that we can just add one to or  subtract one from that kind of  thing and in order to since these are  Vari uh these variables are private in  order to do anything with them I am  going to need a couple of getter methods  for that so public uh int get last check  Nome and that's just going to return  this dot as check num and then same kind  of thing for checks  remaining and I'll clean that up and  with that new functionality in place  let's go over to our test program and  give that a shot so uh now I've got the  ability to also get the last check  number  so number  equals or checks from uh last last check  number okay now um as you're probably  going to guess here the last check  number is going to be zero because we  haven't set we haven't set that to  anything but that demonstrates that this  is indeed working now just to make this  clear and I hope it kind of already is  but if we come back up to here to our  we've got this bank account instance  called account one I can't  get a last check number from account one  because that's not a checking account  that's a bank account so the idea is  we're extending a bank account into a  checking account and we're adding some  stuff that stuff doesn't apply to a bank  account I think that's kind of implied  or I hope it is but I always like to  make that clear um not because you won't  understand it but because when you're  writing code that's an easy thing to get  confused about is wait a second am I am  I using a a bank account here or a  checking account here uh so the things  that we add to a subass are not  available to the super  class let me go ahead and fix that get  us back to where it's working so we want  to add some methods to our checking  account as well not just these uh fields  that we've added so let's go back to  that  account and take a look at what we got  and the first method we want to add is  going to be a method for writing a check  and this is going to be what I would  call a modifier method because it's  going to modify um one or more pieces of  data within our class so modifier  methods and this is going to be public  and for now we're going to say that a a  check writing a check doesn't return a  true or false at the time you write a  check we don't you know have any way of  checking what the balance is and knowing  if it's valid or not it might overdraw  it might balance right so we're going to  write a check and for for our purposes  here we're going to say that we need to  specify the amount of the check and what  the check number is um as I mentioned  this is not the most realistic uh  checking account approximation here  because you know we're not we're not  going to keep track of who the check is  to or what the date was or anything like  that I'm guessing it doesn't matter  because probably a lot of the people  watching this video have never written a  check in their life because you do  everything online now um but it's still  a good analogy I hope for  for this inheritance  idea and the first thing we're going to  do is we're going to update the last  check number uh variable here because if  we have written a check then now the  last check  number is going to be equal to whatever  check number we've passed in here uh  this this integer that's a  parameter so that updates that the other  thing we need to update of course is the  balance and so we can say um this.  balance minus equals  amount and we've run into an error okay  the problem is Visual Studio code  doesn't doesn't uh know what balance is  and here's why when I created my bank  account class I very correctly specified  balance to be private because we always  make our instance variables private um  but that causes a problem private means  that no other class can access it well  checking account is another class and it  kind of needs access to that variable so  we have a few different ways we can  address this we have um one way of  addressing this that we absolutely  should not do and then we have a couple  options that are okay and so let's start  with the one we should not do um and one  that I see students do every semester is  they come over to the bank account class  and oh this is easy enough I'll just  make that public this is particularly  popular with python programmers because  in Python you don't run into this kind  of restriction python just lets you do  whatever you want and I come back over  here and hey great it works this is all  good it's not all good because  objectoriented programmers heads just  exploded um remember we never let anyone  touch our privates these variables are  private for a  reason we want them to be protected we  want them to be  um made safe from people messing around  with them uh and the reason here is that  if somebody shouldn't just be able to  come along and manipulate the balance  that's the whole reason we have um these  methods in this class if you want to  change the balance you make a deposit or  you make a withdrawal and that's how you  change how much money is there you can't  just come along and change that variable  but in checking account when we write a  check that does change this variable so  again there are a couple different ways  we can address this and one of them is  to go into our bank account and up until  now we've only had public or private but  there is another access modifier we can  use in uh in Java it's called  protected so private doesn't give access  to anybody any class public gives access  to every other class protected is in the  middle and what I wish I was about to  tell you was that the protected keyword  gives access to any subass of bank  account but that's not quite how it  works and in fact I mess up sometimes  when I explain this and I explain it  that way in Java the protected keyword  gives uh package level access so it  gives access to any class within the  within this package and so it's not  quite as good as I would like it to be  but um uh but I always have to say that  carefully because I'm used to kind of  saying well that gives access to the sub  classes um it gives access to more than  that unfortunately but um this is a this  is an appropriate way to solve that  problem okay an object oriented  programming making an instance variable  protected so that subclasses can access  it is the way to go all right and let's  go ahead and test this let's go over to  our test accounts and uh so we've made a  deposit let's say check oops check one.  write check I'm going to say write a  check um for $50 and it's going to be  check number 13 and so when I run this  now we should um see that we have  deposit of deposited 150 we've now  written a check for 50 bucks and it's  check 13 and so the balance is $100 and  then that crazy U floating Point math  there that gives us that that obnoxious  decimal uh afterwards and then we've got  the check number is 13 I'm not going to  bother rounding that off because this is  not the point of the video we're just uh  learning about inheritance uh but this  seems to be working now  let's go back to over to our checking  account I did say that there is another  way to do this and um that is that we  can use the methods provided in our  super class if those help us out and  what I mean by that is that when we  write a check we are kind of making a  withdrawal right we're we're there's  some other stuff associated with it like  a check number but ultimately this line  of code here where we're subtracting the  amount that's a  withdrawal so so what I can do is I can  just use that method from the super  class so I can say um this because this  is this is an instance method this.  withdraw  amount and so now when I run  this code that that writes a check it's  going to bounce into this checking  account method it's going to update the  the last check number and now it's going  to call the withdrawal the withdraw  method and you have to understand how  these method calls work in Java and I'm  going to explain this in kind of  layman's terms here when we have a  method call in Java it's going to First  Look within the current class it's going  to have a look around and say hey I need  to I need to call a withdraw method and  if it has one then it runs it if it  doesn't have one it moves up The  Inheritance tree or up the inheritance  hierarchy and it goes to the super class  and it says oh okay a checking account  extends bank account so let's go look  there and it goes into bank account and  it says hey I'm looking for a withdraw  method do you have one yep we have one  right here and it runs it if I try and  call a method that's not in either of  these so let's say I  call this dot takeout I'm  account then it looks around here and  says well I don't see a takeout method  in checking account so it goes up and  says well that extends bank account so  let's check there hey do you have a  takeout method no we don't have a  takeout method and it gives us an error  it won't compile because it can't find  an implementation of that um we're going  to learn a little later that there's a  little more to it than that because uh  there's one more check that it does it  checks the object class to see if  there's an implementation there but  there's not so um so that line of code  doesn't work this approach of using the  superclass method has a couple of  advantages one of them that I like  because I'm nerdy about objectoriented  programming and encapsulation is that  now I can go back and make this private  again right because I don't need to  access the variable directly I can call  the modifier method that is intended to  edit that for us so that I'm I'm still  protecting um maybe the wrong word to  use since I just got rid of the  protected keyword I'm still keeping that  variable safe I'm still keeping it  encapsulated so I like that aspect of it  but the other aspect that I like is that  if I have code written in this  superclass method I don't need to  duplicate that now because this this um  superclass withdraw method doesn't just  subtract the balance like I like I was  doing it also checks to make sure that  you're able to do that so I don't want  to have to rewrite all of that code and  you can imagine well what if this also  does some other stuff maybe it goes into  a database and it updates some stuff  there or it goes to a website and it  checks things um you know pulls the  balance out of that website I don't want  to have to maintain all that code I I  don't want to have to have that code  duplicated so if I can just call that  method then that makes it uh easier for  me to maintain my code and to make sure  that I'm um I'm following all the rules  that withdrawing money requires now a  couple things to keep in mind just about  the basic idea of inheritance so uh bank  account is my super class and checking  account is my  subass uh I  can still make other sub classes of bank  account right so I can make uh the other  example in my uh in my previous video  was a savings  account okay so I can make a savings  account. Java and I can say that that  extends bank  account and this is going to have you  know stuff that a uh that a savings  account has so it's it might have  private double um interest  rate okay and then it might have a um  method that is uh private void add  interest or calculate interest or  something like that and um I won't  actually  I won't actually Implement that on this  video um but the idea is now I can have  uh multiple subclasses of the bank  account class and in my test program I  can make a savings  account in exactly the same  way now this I'm not going to be able to  demonstrate anything with it since I  didn't really write any code for it but  um but it's going to have uh just like  when we started the video this is going  to have access to deposit and to get the  balance and all of that stuff that comes  with the bank account class so it's not  a it's not a one-time deal I can make as  many sub classes of bank account I can  make another way of saying that is I can  make as many different types of bank  accounts as I need and often we do have  many many different sub classes in fact  one of the very common things we do just  as a design approach is that we make  your bank account might not even be  really an account that we really use  it's just sort of a base class that we  use um to put all of the code that  checking accounts and savings accounts  have and we never actually use a bank  account so all of that is perfectly  fine so this really is just the basics  of how we use inheritance uh we've  learned how to use the extends keyword  to create a subass and we've added some  fields and methods and we've kind of  demonstrated that works in our test  program uh with all of that as a  foundation we can now start learning  some other inheritance Concepts and  we'll do those in separate videos in the  meantime you can reach out if you have  any questions
