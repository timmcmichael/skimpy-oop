in this video we're going to take a look at a concept in object-oriented programming called inheritance I'm going to start this off assuming that you have uh a sense of object-oriented programming on just a very basic level uh you need to know what classes and objects are and how they relate to one another you're going to need some basic vocabulary that we use when talking about um about classes and objects so if you're not quite to that point yet maybe go check out some other resources and then come back here when you're ready to uh take a look at inheritance uh and the other thing upfront is that this video is going to talk about uh inheritance as an idea and as a um a feature of objectoriented programming we're not going to get into writing code in this video because that's going to depend on the programming language that you're using and you'll move on to that um soon enough when we talk about object-oriented programming we talk about the four pillars of o op uh inheritance is one of those along with abstraction encapsulation and polymorphism uh we're not going to get into those um those other three in this video and as I like to do we'll start with just the the very basic question what is inheritance so in our life outside of programming inheritance is a term that refers to you know things that you get from your parents so maybe you inherit a big pile of money or or a big house um but that kind of stuff really depends on the circumstances obviously there are some things that you inherit no matter what uh for example you might inherit your parents hair color somebody says hey where'd you get that great hair oh I inherited it from my parent in that case you've inherited a characteristic or an attribute uh you might also notice that you have some kind of um habit but you know some mannerism from your parents maybe uh you tap your fingers in a certain way and you notice that your mom or dad does that in that case you've kind of inherited a behavior in programming um as a kind of a technical definition of inheritance we're going to say that uh inheritance is the ability to base a class on a different class and it turns out that just like in real life in uh in our programming in oop um our class or our objects can inherit attributes and behaviors too let's take an example of a bank account uh so there are going to be some attributes and behaviors that will be common to all bank accounts they're going to have an account number an owner name and a balance that we need to keep track of uh we're going to have the ability to make deposits and withdrawals and we're going to need to be able to to get the balance and obviously all kinds of other stuff too but for a simplified version of it but it turns out that there are different kinds of bank accounts you might have a checking account and a savings account for example you can see that all three of these classes all three of these things have a lot in common inheritance allows us to say that a checking account is a type of bank account so it can inherit the behaviors and attributes that any bank account has and since a savings account is also a type of bank account it can inherit those same things now a key benefit here to using inheritance is that anything that's inherited by a class doesn't have to be reimplemented in other words you don't have to write code for those things you've already written the code in the bank account class instead we can just add the attributes and behaviors that are specific to those kinds of accounts now a checking account has all the attributes and behaviors of a bank account plus those things that are specific to a checking account only like the last check number that was written uh the ability to write a check and the ability to reorder checks um similarly a savings account is going to inherit all of those attributes and behaviors that are already in a bank account and then we can add on uh the interest rate and an a method to calculate and add interest into the balance now we're going to need some vocabulary to be able to talk about these relationships right this hierarchy of relationships that we are establishing um so at the at the very top of this the class that everything is going to be in uh inheriting from uh we can refer to that as the parent class and any class that inherits from that we can refer to that as a child class now when we talk about implementing these in our code we also are going to start using some other terms so C coders might refer to these as a base class and a derived class and in Java we might call them a super class and a subass and those last two are the ones that I tend to use a lot um when we're talking about the design phase which is what we're doing in this video it's probably more correct to use the terms parent and child but honestly I use them all pretty interchangeably and as far as I can tell so does everybody else the uh the next step in describing this is when we say that um one class inherits from another the word we use is extends so we say that a checking account extends bank account and that makes sense because a checking account takes what the bank account has and can do and it adds on to it or it goes beyond a bank account it essentially extends the functionality of a bank account same thing for a savings account which is going to extend the function ality of a bank account as well one thing we can do to sort of selfcheck and make sure that we are um thinking about our inheritance correctly when we're do when we're doing our design is what we call the is a test and uh the idea here is that inheritance is used when one class is a specific type of another class so we could say a checking account is a bank account that makes sense so a checking account extends bank account we wouldn't say that a savings account is a checking account right a savings account you can't write checks and and do all that kind of stuff so it wouldn't be appropriate to set up um with savings account extending checking account a savings account is a type of bank account so it's going to extend the bank account class just like checking account does and we can go beyond that I didn't show it here but we can have a VIP savings account which maybe has some other features and a higher interest rate or something like that that could extend savings account which extends bank account and so we can have multiple levels of this and in fact it turns out that there are uh some other kind of variations or or other ways to look at inheritance relationships especially when we get into the idea of polymorphism which is another one of those pillars of object-oriented programming that um that I started started with um that's really beyond the scope of what we're doing here but just understand that um this is the simplest example of inheritance and there can be other uh other things that we can do with it but for now I think this gives us uh enough of an understanding of what inheritance is to go off now and see how to implement that in our own programming language that's the next step for you but for now if you have any questions be sure and reach out
