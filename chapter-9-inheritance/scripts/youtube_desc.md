# 9A - Introduction to Inheritance

I was recently shocked to learn that my inheritance is going to be my mom's old clothes and a few rusty screwdrivers. Turns out, my parent don't actually have any money. You can imagine my disappointment! But I can still have inheritance when I'm coding, and it is really helpful for programmers like me who don't like to type the same code multiple times.

We're going to take a look at how inheritance relationships work from an OOP design perspective. We'll discuss the concept of inheritance, explore the terminology used to describe inheritance relationships, and introduce the "is a" test to determine if inheritance is appropriate for a given scenario. We'll also examine a simple example of inheritance using a BankAccount class.

# 9B - Extending a Class in Java

Time to take our classes to the next level! Those boring old bank accounts are just so... generic. Let's extend a helping hand to our classes and give them some new features.

In this video, we learn how to extend a class in Java, setting up an inheritance relationship between a superclass and a subclass. We'll see the syntax for a simple inheritance relationship

# 9C - Method Overriding in Java

Overriding is no big deal to me. My wife overrides my ideas and decisions all the time. That's okay, because my judgment is... suspect. 

We need to take a look at the "inheritance hierarchy" and learn how method calls work in a subclass. Armed with that knowledge, we'll change how a method works in a subclass by overriding it. We'll revisit our BankAccount example and try some overriding. We'll also introduce the 'super' keyword and the 'toString()' method.

# 9D - Constructors and Inheritance in Java

My last few video descriptions have been a little negative, so I need to focus on being constructive. Inheritance relationships are important, and I vow to start being more of a SUPERclass.

In this video, we'll see how constructors work their way through the inheritance hierarchy. We'll add constructors to our BankAccount example, and we'll see how constructors are called in a subclass. We'll also discuss the 'super' keyword and how (and why) it can be used to call a superclass constructor.

2:22 Seeing Constructor Behavior in Action
5:08 The Challenge with Parameters
7:40 Calling a Superclass Constructor
9:07 Passing Parameters

# 9E - Arrays of Subclasses in Java

I got a little freaked out when my wife mentioned being a fan of polymorphism. I mean, I'm not sure I want to be treated like my parents. But she has convinced me that polymorphism opens up a whole new world and can even be fun!

In this video, we'll dip our toes in the world of polymorphism with arrays that can hold subclasses that extend the same superclass. We'll see how polymorphism allows us to call methods on subclass objects, and we'll learn how to determine an object's class. We'll also see how overriding works in the context of polymorphism.

3:01 Creating an Array of BankAccounts
5:05 Calling Methods on Subclass Objects
