# 9A - Introduction to Inheritance

I was recently shocked to learn that my inheritance is going to be my mom's old clothes and a few rusty screwdrivers. Turns out, may parent don't actually have any money. You can imagine my disappointment! But I can still have inheritance when I'm coding, and it is really helpful for programmers like me who don't like to type the same code multiple times.

We're going to take a look at how inheritance relationships work from an OOP design perspective. We'll discuss the concept of inheritance, explore the terminology used to describe inheritance relationships, and introduce the "is a" test to determine if inheritance is appropriate for a given scenario. We'll also examine a simple example of inheritance using a BankAccount class.

# 9B - Extending a Class in Java

Time to take our classes to the next level! Those boring old bank accounts are just so... generic. Let's extend a helping hand to our classes and give them some new features.

In this video, we learn how to extend a class in Java, setting up an inheritance relationship between a superclass and a subclass. We'll see the syntax for a simple inheritance relationship

# 9C - Method Overriding in Java

Overriding is no big deal to me. My wife overrides my ideas and decisions all the time. That's okay, because my judgement is... suspect. 

We need to take a look at the "inheritance hierarchy" and learn how method calls work in a subclass. Armed with that knowledge, we'll change how a method works in a subclass by overriding it. We'll revisit our BankAccount example and try some overriding. We'll also introduce the 'super' keyword and the 'toString()' method.

0:00 Intro
1:27 "Multiple Inheritance"
3:00 Inheritance Hierarchies
4:50 Method Calls in a Subclass
7:00 Changing a Method in a Subclass
8:05 Revisiting our BankAccount Example
10:20 Implementation Example (Friends, but not the TV show)
14:04 Overriding BankAccount Methods
18:05 Troubleshooting a Method Call
20:16 Using the 'super' Keyword
22:11 The 'toString()' Method
24:34 One Class to Rule Them All!

# 8D - Arrays of Objects in Java

These primitive arrays are a lot of fun and all, but we're fancy-schmancy object-oriented programmers. Time to step up our game and start adding some real live objects to our arrays.

This video explains using arrays that hold objects in Java, specifically focusing on a custom Dog class. It highlights common challenges new programmers face when dealing with arrays of objects and emphasizes that arrays of objects are similar to arrays of primitive types. The video demonstrates how to instantiate objects and add them to an array, perform traversals, and use getter methods to access object properties. It also covers initialization lists with objects.

0:00 Intro
1:05 Defining and Populating an Object Array
3:30 Traversing the Object Array
5:17 Using an Array Initialization List
7:08 Calling Instance Methods
8:50 Outro

# 8E - "For-Each" Loops in Java

I've been wearing my precious little fingers down the bone writing all of these traversal loops. I mean, those 'for' loops are just sooooo long. I don't have time to write all of that code! I need a shortcut! Fortunately, lots of programmers want shortcuts, and the Java development team heard our cries. 

In this video, we explore the "for-each" loop in Java, which traverses a loop without making us use an index. We compare the "for-each" loop with traditional "for" loops, highlighting its advantages and limitations.

1:13 "For-Each" Syntax
4:03 Calling Instance Methods
5:33 Limitations of "For-Each" Loops
7:32 Using an Accumulator
8:02 Iterating Through an Array of Primitives
