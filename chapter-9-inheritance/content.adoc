=== Inheritance Overview

Inheritance is a core object-oriented programming concept that allows you reuse code from one class--known as a _parent class_--in a new class, which we call a _child class_.
In the same way that people can inherit traits from their parents, child classes inherit the attributes and behaviors of their parent classes. 
This means that a child class automatically has all of the fields and methods of a parent class, and just like people, a child class can also have its own unique fields and methods.

Though there are other ways to think about inheritance, I encourage students to think of it as a way to create a class that is a more specific version of another class. For example, if you have a class called `Athlete`, you could create a child class called `FootballPlayer`.
A `FootballPlayer` is a type of `Athlete`, and there might be other types of athletes that are not football players: gymnasts, tennis players, and so on.

TIP: We can think of inheritance as an "is-a" relationship: a `House` _is a_ `Building`, for example. When deciding whether to use inheritance, ask yourself if the child class _is a_ type of the parent class. We call this the _is-a test_.

When we design classes in UML, we use an arrow to indicate inheritance. The arrow points from the child class to the parent class.

.Example of an `Athlete` parent class with two child classes, `FootballPlayer` and `TennisPlayer`
image::AthleteDiagram.png["Class diagram for the `Athlete` class and two child classes, `FootballPlayer` and `TennisPlayer`"]

// Image rendered at plantuml.com with the following code:
// [plantuml, target="AthleteDiagram", format=png]
// ----
// @startuml
// skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
// class Athlete {
//    -athleteName:String
//    -age:int
//    -weight:int
//    +void run()
//    +void jump()
//    +void throwBall()
// }
// class FootballPlayer {
//    -teamName:String
//    -position:String
//    +void tackle()
//    +void pass()
// }
// class TennisPlayer {
//     -dominantHand:String
//     -rank:int
//     +void serve()
//     +void volley()
// }
// Athlete <|-- FootballPlayer
// Athlete <|-- TennisPlayer
// @enduml
// ----

In this example, the `FootballPlayer` class inherits the fields and methods of the `Athlete` class, so we don't have to rewrite those, and then it adds on its own unique fields and methods, like `teamName` and `position`.

=== Implementing Inheritance

When we move from a design in UML to writing actual code--which we refer to as _implementation_--we use different terms to describe the relationships between classes.

A parent class becomes a _superclass_, and a child class becomes a _subclass_. You also hear the terms _base class_ and _derived class_ to describe the same relationship, especially in other programming languages.

In Java, we use the `extends` keyword to indicate that one class is a subclass of another class. Here's an example of a `FootballPlayer` class that extends the `Athlete` class:

[source,java]
----
public class Athlete {
    private String athleteName;
    private int age;
    private int weight;

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running!");
    }

    public void jump() {
        System.out.println("Jumping!");
    }

    public void throwBall() {
        System.out.println("Throwing!");
    }
}

public class FootballPlayer extends Athlete {
    private String teamName;
    private String position;

    public void tackle() {
        System.out.println("Tackling!");
    }

    public void pass() {
        System.out.println("Passing!");
    }
}

=== Inheritance Hierarchies and Overriding

When we extend a class, we are building an _inheritance hierarchy_. 
This is a tree-like structure where each class has only one parent class (such as our `Athlete` class), but can have multiple child classes (like `FootballPlayer` and `TennisPlayer`).

.Inheritance hierarchy for the `Athlete` class
image::AthleteDiagram.png["Inheritance hierarchy for the `Athlete` class"]]

When a method is called on an object, java begins by looking for that method in the object's class. 
If it doesn't find the method there, it looks in the superclass.
If there's no method in there it goes to *that* class's superclass, and so on up the hierarchy.
If it gets to the top of the hierarchy and still hasn't found the method, the code won't compile.

[source,java]
----
TennisPlayer serena = new TennisPlayer();
serena.serve(); <.>
serena.run(); <.>
----

<.> The compiler checks the `TennisPlayer` class for the `serve()` method. Since it finds an implementation there, it will execute that code.
<.> The compiler checks the `TennisPlayer` class for the `run()` method. Since it doesn't find an implementation there, it will check the superclass, `Athlete`. Since it finds the `run()` method there, it will execute that code.

In some cases, you might want to provide a different implementation of a method in a subclass. This is called _method overriding_. Because the compiler starts at the bottom of the inheritance hierarchy and works its way up, it will use the overridden method in the subclass instead of the method in the superclass.

If a `TennisPlayer` has a specific way of running that is different from the way an `Athlete` runs, you can override the `run()` method in the `TennisPlayer` class.
The `FootballPlayer` class will still use the `run()` method from the `Athlete` class, unless you override it in the `FootballPlayer` class as well.

[source,java]
----
public class TennisPlayer extends Athlete {
    private String dominantHand;
    private int rank;

    public void serve() {
        System.out.println("Serving!");
    }

    public void volley() {
        System.out.println("Volleying!");
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running like a tennis player!");
    }
}
----

TIP: The `@Override` annotation is optional, but it's a good idea to use it. It tells the compiler that you intend to override a method from the superclass. If you make a mistake in the method signature, the compiler will let you know.

==== The `Object` Class

In Java, every class is a subclass of the `Object` class. 
This means that every class that does not explicitly extend another class is a subclass of `Object`.
The result is that `Object` is at the top of the inheritance hierarchy for all Java classes--and every object inherits the methods in the `Object` class.

The `Object` class provides a handful of methods, but there is one that is particularly useful at this stage of our learning: the `toString()` method.
This method returns a `String` representation of the object.
