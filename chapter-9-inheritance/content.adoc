=== Inheritance Overview

Inheritance is a core object-oriented programming concept that allows you reuse code from one class--known as a _parent class_--in a new class, which we call a _child class_.
In the same way that people can inherit traits from their parents, child classes inherit the attributes and behaviors of their parent classes. 
This means that a child class automatically has all of the fields and methods of a parent class, and just like people, a child class can also have its own unique fields and methods.

Though there are other ways to think about inheritance, I encourage students to think of it as a way to create a class that is a more specific version of another class. For example, if you have a class called `Athlete`, you could create a child class called `FootballPlayer`.
A `FootballPlayer` is a type of `Athlete`, and there might be other types of athletes that are not football players: gymnasts, tennis players, and so on.

TIP: We can think of inheritance as an "is-a" relationship: a `House` _is a_ `Building`, for example. When deciding whether to use inheritance, ask yourself if the child class _is a_ type of the parent class. We call this the _is-a test_.

When we design classes in UML, we use an arrow to indicate inheritance. The arrow points from the child class to the parent class.

.Example of an `Athlete` parent class with two child classes, `FootballPlayer` and `TennisPlayer`
image::AthleteDiagram.png["Class diagram for the `Athlete` class and two child classes, `FootballPlayer` and `TennisPlayer`"]

// Image rendered at plantuml.com with the following code:
// [plantuml, target="AthleteDiagram", format=png]
// ----
// @startuml
// skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
// class Athlete {
//    -athleteName:String
//    -age:int
//    -weight:int
//    +void run()
//    +void jump()
//    +void throwBall()
// }
// class FootballPlayer {
//    -teamName:String
//    -position:String
//    +void tackle()
//    +void pass()
// }
// class TennisPlayer {
//     -dominantHand:String
//     -rank:int
//     +void serve()
//     +void volley()
// }
// Athlete <|-- FootballPlayer
// Athlete <|-- TennisPlayer
// @enduml
// ----

In this example, the `FootballPlayer` class inherits the fields and methods of the `Athlete` class, so we don't have to rewrite those, and then it adds on its own unique fields and methods, like `teamName` and `position`.

=== Implementing Inheritance

When we move from a design in UML to writing actual code--which we refer to as _implementation_--we use different terms to describe the relationships between classes.

A parent class becomes a _superclass_, and a child class becomes a _subclass_. You also hear the terms _base class_ and _derived class_ to describe the same relationship, especially in other programming languages.

In Java, we use the `extends` keyword to indicate that one class is a subclass of another class. Here's an example of a `FootballPlayer` class that extends the `Athlete` class:

[source,java]
----
public class Athlete {
    private String athleteName;
    private int age;
    private int weight;

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running!");
    }

    public void jump() {
        System.out.println("Jumping!");
    }

    public void throwBall() {
        System.out.println("Throwing!");
    }
}

public class FootballPlayer extends Athlete {
    private String teamName;
    private String position;

    public void tackle() {
        System.out.println("Tackling!");
    }

    public void pass() {
        System.out.println("Passing!");
    }
}
----
