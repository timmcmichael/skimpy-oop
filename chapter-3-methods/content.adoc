=== What's the Point?
* Define and call methods

''''

As our programs begin to get larger and more complex, it will be important to keep our code organized. 
Each program we write is contained within a _class_, and classes are the basic building block of an OOP program; we'll explore them in more detail in the next chapter.
Within a program, we can organize code in *methods*.
A method is a collection of statements that work together to complete a single task.
Consider the assembly instructions for a LEGO set.

It might take dozens of steps to put together the set, but taken together, you complete a single task: building the set.
A method is conceptually the same.

If you've worked with other programming languages, you may know methods by a different name. 
In Python, we use functions, and in other languages we use procedures or subroutines. 
All of those terms pretty much mean the same thing, but in Java they're called methods.
And really, they're generally called methods whenever we're using object-oriented programming, so even in Python we sometimes call them methods.

There are a variety of reasons to break your code into methods, but an important advantage for now is *reuseability*. 
Once you create a method, you can use it as often as you'd like.
That means you don't have to type the same code over and over.
In turn, that improves your code's *maintainability*. 
If you have to perform some calculation ten times in your program and have written out that calculation all ten times, a change to the calculation means updating it in all ten places.
But if you put that calculation in a method and use that method ten times, you can just update the method and your changes will automatically be used all ten times.
You'll see additional advantages to methods as you learn more about prgramming.

Once you define a method, you *invoke* the method each time you want it to execute.
We also say that we _call_ a method, which sounds a little cooler than _invoke_ but means the same thing.

=== Defining Your Own Methods

You've been defining a method from the start.
Each program you write includes a method called `main`, which the Java runtime invokes when you run the program.

You've also been calling (_invoking_) methods from the start.
To output text, we've been calling the `println()` and `print()` methods.

TIP: In Java, parentheses *always* indicate a method, whether or not there is anything inside of the parentheses. Anytime you see parentheses in Java code, you're looking at either a method definition or a method call.

Consider this simple method definition:

[source,java]
----
public static void displayCopyright() {
    System.out.println("(C) 2025 by Tim McMichael. All rights reserved.");
}
----

- The `public` keyword is an _access modifier_. Defining the method as `public` makes it possible to call the method from anywhere. More on this later, but for now all of your methods will be `public`.
- The `static` keyword basically means that the method belongs to the class and not an object. That will make more sense in the next chapter, but for now your methods will be `static`.
- The `void` keyword indicates that this method will not return anything. This is called the method's _return type_, and we'll learn about this shortly.
- `displayCopyright` is the identifier for the method, in the same way variables have identifiers. Like variable identifiers, use camelCase to make the name readable--and make the name descriptive. The convention is that the name of a method should describe what it does; usually, that means the identifier is (or includes) a verb.
- The parentheses indicate to the compiler that this is a method, as opposed to a variable or some other fancy thing. You'll see what you can put in the parentheses shortly.

=== Passing Data to Methods

Sometimes a method needs some information in order to carry out its purpose.
For example, the `print()` method needs to know what it's supposed to print.
To provide information to a method, we _pass_ the information in as *arguments*.
So, the `String` we want to output is passed to the `print()` method as an argument, and arguments are always placed inside the parentheses:

`System.out.print("Hello World");`

In this example, "Hello World" is an argument.

To allow a method we create to accept arguments, we have to include that in our method definition.
Within the method we're defining, those pieces of information are called *parameters*.
A parameter is a variable that exists in the method and receives the argument.
We define parameters inside the parentheses in our method definition.

.ParameterExample.java - Defining a parameter and pass in an argument

[source,java]
----
public class ParameterExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printGreeting("Tim"); // <.>
    }

    public static void printGreeting(String name) { // <.>
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }

}
----

<.> "Tim" is the argument.
<.> `name` is the parameter.

In the above example, "Tim" is passed to the `printGreeting()` method as an argument.
Within that method, the parameter `name` stores the argument, so when this code runs, `name` is equal to "Tim".

TIP: The actual value passed in when you call a method is referred to as an _argument_. The variable that receives that value within the method is referred to as a _parameter_.
