'''

As our programs begin to get larger and more complex, it will be important to keep our code organized. 
Each program we write is contained within a _class_, and classes are the basic building block of an OOP program; we'll explore them in more detail in the next chapter.
Within a class or program, we can organize code in *methods*.
A method is a collection of statements that work together to complete a single task.
Consider the assembly instructions for building a LEGO set. 

image::LEGO.png[A few LEGO blocks, width=300]

It might take dozens of small steps to complete the set, but taken together, the instructions execute a single task: building the set.
A method is conceptually the same. 

If you've worked with other programming languages, you may know methods by a different name. 
In Python, we use _functions_, and in other languages we use _procedures_ or _subroutines_. 
All of those terms pretty much mean the same thing, but in Java they're called methods.
And really, they're generally called methods whenever we're using object-oriented programming, so even in Python we sometimes call them methods.

There are a variety of reasons to break our code into methods, but an important advantage for now is *reusability*. 
Once we create a method, we can use it as often as we'd like.
That means we don't have to type the same code over and over.
In turn, that improves our code's *maintainability*. 
If we have to perform some calculation ten times in our program and have written out that calculation all ten times, a change to the calculation means updating it in all ten places.
But if we put that calculation in a method and use that method ten times, we can just update the method and our changes will automatically be used all ten times.
We'll see additional advantages to methods as we learn more about programming.

Once we define a method, we *invoke* the method each time we want it to execute.
We also say that we _call_ a method, which sounds a little cooler than _invoke_ but means the same thing.

=== Defining Our Own Methods

We've been defining a method from the start.
Each program we write includes a method called `main`, which the Java runtime invokes when we run the program.

We've also been calling (_invoking_) methods from the start.
To output text, we've been calling the `println()` and `print()` methods.

TIP: In Java, parentheses *always* indicate a method, whether or not there is anything inside of the parentheses. Anytime you see parentheses in Java code, you're looking at either a method definition or a method call.

A method definition includes a method header followed by a code block.

// TODO: Replace this image/code with a musical example

.A method definition in Java
[source,java]
----
public static void displayCopyright() {
    System.out.println("(C) 2025 by Tim McMichael. All rights reserved.");
}
----

- The `public` keyword is an _access modifier_. Defining the method as `public` makes it possible to call the method from anywhere. More on this later, but for now all of our methods will be `public`.
- The `static` keyword basically means that the method belongs to the class and not an object. That will make more sense in the next chapter, but for now our methods will be `static`.
- The `void` keyword indicates that this method will not return anything. This is called the method's _return type_, and we'll learn about this shortly.
- `displayCopyright` is the identifier for the method, in the same way variables have identifiers. Like variable identifiers, use camelCase to make the name readable--and make the name descriptive. The convention is that the name of a method should describe what it does; usually, that means the identifier is (or includes) a verb.
- The parentheses indicate to the compiler that this is a method, as opposed to a variable or some other fancy thing. You'll see what we can put in the parentheses shortly.

[[variable_scope]] 
=== Variable Scope

As we begin organizing our code into different methods and (when we learn object-oriented programming basics) classes, we'll need to understand how data is compartmentalized within a program.
Whenever we create a class or method--and other structures we'll learn as we go--we use curly braces to define the boundaries and indenting to help make those boundaries clear.
These braces form _code blocks_.

The outermost code block is our class.
Although there are a few things that can go outside the class, like `package` and `import` statements, the class code block contains all of the components of our program.

In some cases we can place one block inside another, as such as putting a method inside a class.
This is called _nesting_ blocks, and a nested block must be completely enclosed; in other words, a method can't be partly in a class and partly out of it.

And some kinds of blocks can't be nested. 
A method can be nested inside a class, but a method cannot be nested inside another method.
Many IDEs, including https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code] use color coding to make code blocks more clear.

.An example of nested blocks in Visual Studio Code.
image::Blocks.png[A screenshot of Java source code with blocks indicated by bracketing]

A variable can only be used or accessed inside the block in which it was declared, or within a block nested within that block; this is the variable's `scope`.
When we refer to a variable, the compiler checks within that code block, or scope, to see if the variable has been declared.
If it doesn't find a variable with that identifier within the current scope, it will move out to the enclosing code block (if it is nested within a class, for example) and check there. 
If the variable is still not found, the compiler stops and produces an error.

Basically, referring to a variable that is declared in a different scope is the same as referring to a variable we never declared at all.
Trying to use a variable in a different code block is referred to as an _out of scope_ reference.

.`ScopeExample.java`. An example of code with an out-of-scope variable reference.
[source,java]
----
public class ScopeExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int favoriteNumber = 7;
        System.out.println(favoriteNumber); <.>

        outputNumber();
    }

    public static void outputNumber() {
        System.out.println(favoriteNumber); <.>
    }
}
----
<.> This is a valid, or _in scope_, reference because `favoriteNumber` is declared within `main()`.
<.> This is an invalid _out of scope_ reference because `favoriteNumber` can only be accessed within `main()`.

==== Variable Shadowing

When we first started using variables, we learned that we can't make two variables with the same name, but it's a little more nuanced than that.
We can't make two variables with the same name _and scope_.
Java *will* allow us to declare a variable with the same name in a different scope, which is called _variable shadowing_.
Shadowing is a *very* bad practice, because it often leads to confusion about which variable is in scope (though we'll see an exception down the road).

The example below can be confusing to beginners and to people who are reading the code quickly.
When `outputNumber()` is called, another variable named `favoriteNumber` is created and assigned the value `18`. 
After that is output, an assignment statement changes that value to `10`. 
Then, program execution returns to `main()`, where a `println()` statement outputs `favoriteNumber` again.
However, _this_ `favoriteNumber` wasn't changed to 10--the other one was.

.`ShadowingExample.java`. An example of variable shadowing, which we should avoid.
[source,java]
----
public class ShadowingExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int favoriteNumber = 7;
        System.out.println(favoriteNumber); <.>

        outputNumber();

        System.out.println(favoriteNumber); <.>
    }

    public static void outputNumber() {
        int favoriteNumber = 18;
        System.out.println(favoriteNumber); <.>
        favoriteNumber = 10;
    }
}
----
<.> This outputs `7`
<.> This outputs `18`, because it refers to the variable declared in `outputNumber()`
<.> This still outputs `7` because the change to `10` is made to the `favoriteNumber` within the `outputNumber()` method.

==== Global Variables

As we can see, variable scope has a big impact on how our code runs.
Beginning programmers sometimes try to avoid scope issues by declaring their variables within the class code block, which makes them accessible to any block nested within the class.
This kind of class-level variable is sometimes called a _global variable_, and the use of global variables is generally discouraged.


.`GlobalVariableExample.java`. An example of a global variable, which we should not use.
[source,java]
----
public class GlobalVariableExample {
    static int favoriteNumber = 7; <.>

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(favoriteNumber);

        outputNumber();

        System.out.println(favoriteNumber);
    }

    public static void outputNumber() {
        System.out.println(favoriteNumber);
        favoriteNumber = 18; <.>
    }
}
----
<.> Declaration at the class level. Note that global variables must be `static`.
<.> This changes the value of `favoriteNumber` to 18 for all methods in the program.

Instead, we'll declare all of our variables within our methods; these are called _local variables_.

WARNING: The use of global or class-level variables in code that you turn in for an assignment in my class is very heavily penalized. As much as possible, I try to reinforce best practices--and that means minimizing the use of global variables.

Of course, this presents a problem.
What if we need access to a variable in another method?
The best practice is to pass that variable value to the method as needed, and for the method to pass back a value when necessary.

NOTE: In the next chapter, we will start using variables that look a lot like the global variables I just said we shouldn't use. To be clear, those _instance variables_ behave differently and serve a different purpose. They are _global variables_ as described here.

=== Passing Data to Methods

Sometimes a method needs some information in order to carry out its purpose.
For example, the `print()` method needs to know what it's supposed to print.
To provide information to a method, we _pass_ the information in as *arguments*.
So, the `String` we want to output is passed to the `print()` method as an argument, and arguments are always placed inside the parentheses:

`System.out.print("Hello World");`

In this example, "Hello World" is an argument.

We establish what information a method needs as part of the method definition.
Within the method we're defining, those pieces of information are called *parameters*.
A parameter is a variable that exists in the method and receives the argument, and it's declared inside the parentheses in our method definition.
The methods we've defined so far didn't need any information, so we haven't been putting anything in the parentheses--but now let's see an example with a parameter.

.ParameterExample.java - Defining a parameter and passing in an argument
[source,java]
----
public class ParameterExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        outputGreeting("Tim"); <.>
    }

    public static void outputGreeting(String name) { <.>
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }

}
----

<.> "Tim" is the argument.
<.> `name` is the parameter.

In the above example, "Tim" is passed to the `outputGreeting()` method as an argument.
Within that method, the parameter `name` stores the argument, so when this code runs, `name` is equal to "Tim".

TIP: The actual value passed in when we call a method is referred to as an _argument_. The variable that receives that value within the method is referred to as a _parameter_.

=== Returning Values

The methods we've seen to this point are basically commands--they simply perform a task, and then when they're done, program execution just goes back to the method that called it and resumes there.
But we can also create methods that are like questions--they perform a chunk of code, but when they are finished they give back an answer.

Consider this method:
[source,java]
----
public static void printFavNum() { <.>
    int favNum = 10 - 3;
    System.out.print(favNum);
}

public static int getFavNum() { <.>
    int favNum = 10 - 3;
    return favNum;
}
----

<.> This specifies a return type of `void`
<.> This specifies a return type of `int`

The first method is a command to print out a favorite number, so it does not return anything. 
The `void` in the method header is the return type, and _void_ basically means nothing; this method returns nothing.
The second method is asking to get a favorite number, so it is going to give back an `int`. The return type is specified as `int`.
The `return` statement sends the `favNum` value back to the method that called `getFavNum()`.

IMPORTANT: If a method has a return type of anything other than `void`, it will only compile if it has a `return` statement followed by a value (literal or variable) of the specified type.

This means that methods themselves essentially have data types.
`printFavNum()` has a data type of `void`. 
`getFavNum()` has a data type of `int`.
Since methods have types, we can use them in statements just as we'd use a literal or variable of that type. 
For example, the following line of code is valid:

`int answer = 18 + getFavNum();`

This evaluated the same way as any other assignment statement. It starts on the right and finds that method call, so it will execute `getFavNum()` and plug the returned value into the operation, resulting in `18 + 7` and ultimately evaluating to `25`, which is then assigned to `answer`.

A `return` statement in a `void` method stops execution of the method and returns to the calling method.

[source,java]
----
public static void shortCircuit() {
   System.out.print(“This runs...”);
   return;
   System.out.print(“This can never run!”);
}
----

The second print() statement won't execute because the return statement ends the method. The compiler doesn't like these kinds of _unreachable statements_, though, so it will not compile.

`return` statements in `void` methods will have some uses for us later on.

NOTE: A Java method can only return one piece of data, so it can only have one return type.  
	
==== Returning vs. Outputting

Generally speaking, it's better to return values from a method rather than outputting values.
There are a few reasons for this, but consider an obvious one. 
If we use a `print()` method, our code is limited to only working in a console application. 
That's fine for now, because it's the only kind of application we know how to make!
But what if we want to use that same code in a web application, or a mobile app? 
That `print()` statement won't work--rather, the user will never see the result, because they won't have a console window.

Consider this code:

[source,java]
----
public class BadOutput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        kingOfSoul();
    }

    public static void kingOfSoul() {
        System.out.println("Otis Redding");
    }

}
----

If the `kingOfSoul()` method knows who the King of Soul is, how do we print that out if we can't perform the output inside the method?
The solution is to return the String and perform the output in `main()`.

[source,java]
----
public class GoodOutput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(kingOfSoul());
    }

    public static String kingOfSoul() {
        return "Otis Redding";
    }

}
----

This is another example of something that seems annoying, like it's just extra work.
When we're learning new things, we sometimes have to accept the wisdom of people who are experienced--and recognize that eventually we'll see the point.
We're all about learning good habits and best practices around here, so we'll almost always return values rather than printing them.

There are times when we want a method whose sole purpose is to produce some output. 
In that case, be sure to give it an appropriate identifier.
Notice that those kinds of methods in my examples have _print_ or _output_ in the name.

I rarely want students to create methods that produce output, and when I do I always make that explicit in my directions. 
When I refer to _returning_ something, I mean just that. 
The rule of thumb is, *all input and output statements should be in the `main()` method* and data should be passed around as necessary.

TIP: I strongly penalize input and output statements outside of the `main()` method because I'm trying to build habits that will serve us well as we learn more about programming.

[[overloading]]
=== Overloading a Method

Sometimes the task, action, or calculation that a method produces has different ways of operating depending on the circumstances.

Consider a method that calculates the average age of two people:

[source,java]
----
public static double averageAge(int age1, int age2) {
       return (double) (age1 + age2) / 2;
   }
----

This is a pretty straightforward method. 
Notice that the return statement uses casting with `(double)` to ensure that the result is not truncated.

If we want to calculate an average age of 3 people, we could almost use the same method. 
We want a method that still calculates the average age, but takes three arguments and divides by 3, instead of 2.

To create another version of a method that operates a little differently, we can use _method overloading_. 
To overload a method, we write a new method with the same identifier, but with a different set of parameters. 
An overload for our `averageAge()` method could look like this:

[source,java]
----
public static double averageAge(int age1, int age2, int age3) {
        return (double) (age1 + age2 + age3) / 3;
    }
----

Note that the method identifier is exactly the same, but this version accepts three `int` arguments instead of two.
That difference allows the compiler to easily determine which implementation of the method is being called: if there are two `int`s in the parenthesis, it calls the first implementation, and if there are three `int`s, it calls the second implementation. 
When we're using the method, we can call whichever best suits our needs at the time.

The compiler can also easily distinguish overloaded methods if the _types_ of the parameters are different.
An implementation that accepts `double`s is valid:

[source,java]
----
    public static double averageAge(double age1, double age2, double age3) {
        return (double) (age1 + age2 + age3) / 3;
    }
----

If the compiler sees a call to `averageAge()` with three `double` values, it will invoke this last version.

==== Incorrect Overloading
Overloaded methods *must* have differences in the number and/or types of the parameters. 
The _names_ of those parameters doesn't differentiate them, so different names is not enough to make a valid overload.


.`BadOverloading.java`. An invalid example of overloading.
[source,java]
----
public class BadOverloading {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(area(15, 10)); <.>
    }

    // Calculates area of a rectangle
    public static double area(double length, double width) {
        return length * width;
    }

    // Calculates area of an oval
    public static double area(double smallRadius,
            double bigRadius) {
        double area = 3.14 * smallRadius * bigRadius;
        return area;
    }

}
----

<.> The compiler can't tell if we want the area implementation of a rectangle of the implementation for an oval.

The term we use to describe a method's identifier and parameter list (the number, order and types of parameters) is a _method signature_. 
The method signature must be unique so the compiler can identify which method code to run.

.`AverageAge.java`. A valid example of method overloading.
[source, java]
----
public class AverageAge {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(averageAge(1.25, 1.5, .5)); // <.>
        System.out.println(averageAge(10, 20)); // <.>
        System.out.println(averageAge(10, 20, 25)); // <.>
    }

    public static double averageAge(int age1, int age2) {
        return (double) (age1 + age2) / 2;
    }

    public static double averageAge(int age1, int age2, int age3) {
        return (double) (age1 + age2 + age3) / 3;
    }

    public static double averageAge(double age1, double age2, double age3) {
        return (double) (age1 + age2 + age3) / 3;
    }

}
----

<.> The compiler sees three `double` values, so it calls the third implementation.
<.> The compiler sees two `int` values, so it calls the first implementation.
<.> The compiler sees three `int` values, so it calls the second implementation.
