# 3B - Passing Data to a Method in Java
You've passed cars on the freeway. You've passed ninth grade gym class. You've passed gas. You've maybe even passed a football. But have you ever passed...data?

Think of all those lonely methods out there just waiting to have some memory filled with that sweet, sweet data. Don't just sit there passing the time, get in there and start passing data to methods.

We'll take a look at how to use parameters in a method definition, and how to call a method with arguments. We'll also get another perspective on variable scope.

0:00 Intro
1:06 Scope and Global Variables
2:25 Parameters
4:02 Arguments
6:08 Multiple Parameters
6:38 Outro

# 3C - Returning Data from a Method in Java

Do you feel like you give, and give, and give--but never get anything back? Stop creating selfish methods and learn to create and use methods that return data.

In this video, we'll look at how to define a method that returns a value, and how to call that method and use the returned value.

0:00 Intro
0:40 Returning vs. Outputting
1:53 Handling the Return Value 
2:56 Outro
