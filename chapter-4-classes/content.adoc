=== OOP Basics

#This section is almost finished, but in the meantime you can instead read section 4.1 (page 115) in the textbook.#

Until now, we have been organizing our programs into methods, which is a procedural programming approach.
We've been thinking of a program as a collection of tasks that need to be performed in a specific order.
There's nothing wrong with this approach, but it can get cumbersome as a program grows in size and complexity--and it isn't always an intuitive way to plan our programs.

Now we're ready to start our transition to object-oriented programming (OOP), which lets us think about programs the way we think about the world around us.
Instead of thinking about a program as a bunch of tasks, we can think of it as a bunch of objects that interact with each other.
As an example, the old-school video game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man[*Pac-Man*] has the main character (an object) moving around a maze (another object), and avoiding four ghosts (yep, four more objects).

If we decide to create Pac-Man, we'll still be using methods, but they won't be the basic building blocks of our programs.
Instead, we'll be organizing our programs into *classes*, which are blueprints--or recipes--for creating *objects*.
A class defines the *attributes* and *behaviors* of the objects--and those are the variables and methods we'll write to create our programs.

In OOP, our planning for a program starts by deciding what objects--and therefore, what classes--we'll need in order to implement the functionality we want.
To help organize our thinking, we'll use a tool called a *class diagram*, which gives a visual representation of the classes and their relationships in our program.
The format programmers use for class diagrams is called UML (Unified Modeling Language). 
The UML standards are extensive, but we'll be using a simplified version in this course. 

Consider a program that a restaurant might use to handle orders. A simple class to represent an order might look like this:

.Example of a class diagram for a restaurant order
[plantuml, target="OrderDiagram", format=png]
----
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
class Order {
   -serverName:String
   -tableNumber:int
   -appetizer:String
   -entree:String
   -dessert:String
   -totalPrice:double
   +void sendToKitchen()
   +void printBill()
   +double closeBill()
}
@enduml
----

The top section of the digram has the name of the class, which is `Order`.
The next section is for the attributes of the class--the information the class will store. This example has attributes for the server's name, the table number, the items ordered, and the total price.
The bottom section is for the beahviors of the class, which are the actions the class can perform (or that we can do with the class).
With an order, we might send it to the kitchen, print the bill, or close the bill.

We'll learn more about the symbols and conventions of UML as we go along, but for now the important part is that we can use class diagrams to help us plan our programs--and to talk about OOP concepts without bogging down on code details.

Many programs will have multiple classes, and diagramming those before we start coding helps us work out details and find potential problems.
Diagrams are also useful for sharing information about a class for other programmers who might need to use it.

Classes in and of themselves can't really be used in a program; they're just the blueprints for objects.
To use a class, we create an object--or _instance_--of the class, which is a specific version of the class with its own attributes and behaviors.
A recipe analogy also works here: a class is like a recipe for a cake, and an object is a specific cake made from that recipe.
One class can be used to make as many instances as we need, which is part of what makes OOP so powerful.

In our Pac-Man example, we could create one Ghost class and use it to create all four Ghost objects we'll need in the game.

=== Encapsulation

Object-oriented programming is all about creating objects that can interact with each other.
Since the objects will be interacting, we need to think about how to keep them from interfering with each other in ways we don't want.
If we have an `Order` class in a program used by a restaurant, we don't want some other class to change attributes in a way that disrupts the program--like changing the entree selection to something that's not on the menu, or setting the price to a negative number, for example.

To prevent this kind of tampering, whether it's intention or accidental, OOP relies on a concept called *encapsulation*.
Encapsulation of a class means that attributes are hidden from the outside world, and only the behaviors of the class can access and change them.
As an analogy, consider the counter at a fast food restaurant. You can't just reach over and grab a handful of fries; you have to ask the employee behind the counter to get them for you.
In this analogy, the food is encapsulated and you can only access it by using a behavior, like "order food".

Another way to think of encapsulation is the way we interacte with other people in social situations.
When we encounter a stranger, they don't automatically know our name and phone number; they have to ask us for that information.
We've encapsulated our personal information, and we only share it when and how we choose to.

In Java, encapsulation is not a strict requirement, and our code will still work if we don't use it.
But it's a best practice--and an important one--so we will encapsulate all of our classes in this course.
In fact, I would argue that if you don't encapsulate your classes, you're not really doing object-oriented programming. 
And that's what we're here to learn.

=== Defining and Using a Class

#This section is not finished, but in the meantime this content is covered in section 4.2 (page 117) through 4.5 in the textbook.#

We'll look at a program to keep rudimentary weather records; for a single day's weather data, we'll have a class called `WeatherRecord`.

.Class diagram for the `WeatherRecord` class
[plantuml, target="WeatherRecordDiagram", format=png]
----
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
class WeatherRecord {
   -date:String
   -highTemp:int
   -avgWindspeed:int
   +setDate(String):void
   +setHighTemp(int):void
   +setAvgWindspeed(int):void
   +displayData():void
}
@enduml
----

To implement this class in code, we'll start with a class header. The class header always follows the same pattern: an *access modifier*, the keyword `class`, and the name of the class.
The class header is followed by a code block, enclosed in curly braces.

.`WeatherRecord.java`. A class header and code block. 
[source,java]
----
public class WeatherRecord {

   // class code goes here

}
----

Access modifier:: The `public` keyword means that the class can be accessed from any other class. Though this is technically optional, you should always use `public` for now.
`class` keyword:: The keyword that tells Java we're defining a class. It's required. We'll eventually be able to create different kinds of classes and OOP structures, but for now we're just creating regular classes.
*Class name* (or _identifier_):: The name of the class, which should be a noun that describes the object the class represents--and is singular, so there's no _s_ at the end. The identifier should start with a capital, with the first letter of each word capitalized (like `WeatherRecord`). This is similar to the _camelCase_ naming convention we've been using for variables and methods; it's called _PascalCase_.

The class code block is where we define the different components that make up the class, which we call the *class members*. 
To begin with, we'll focus on two types of class members: *fields* and *methods*.

==== Fields

Fields are the implementation of the attributes of the class.
The are also known as *instance variables* because they similar to the variables we've been using in our programs, but their scope is the object created from the class, not the method where they're defined.
A field is unique to the object; if we make two objects from our `WeatherRecord` class, each object will have its own date, high temperature, and average temperature.
If we change the hig temperature for one object, it won't affect the high temperature for the other object.

Fields are declared like our other variables, but they are encapsulated using the `private` access modifier.
This means that the fields can only be accessed and changed by the methods of the class, not by other classes--which controls how the data is used and prevents accidental or invalid changes.

WARNING: Since a class will compile and run even if we leave off the `private` access modifier, it's easy to forget to use it. But don't worry, I'll help you remember by taking huge points off your assignments if you don't make your fields `private`. As I mentioned, you're not really doing OOP if you don't encapsulate your fields, and we're learning OOP.

Fields are declared at the top of the class using the same naming conventions we've been using for variables: a descriptive name formatted in camelCase.

.`WeatherRecord.java`. Fields added to the `WeatherRecord` class.
[source,java]
----
public class WeatherRecord {
   private String date;
   private int highTemp;
   private int avgTemp;
}
----

In our original class diagram, we indicated that the fields were private by using a `-` in front of the field name.

You might remember from https://timmcmichael.github.io/skimpy-oop/_0011_methods_chapter_3.html#_variable_scope[the section on variable scope in Chapter 0011] that using global variables is terrible, and every time we create a global variable, 





// Mention that fields look like global variables, which we know are evil. These are instance variables
