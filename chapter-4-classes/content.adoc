=== OOP Basics

Until now, we have been organizing our programs into methods, which is a procedural programming approach.
We've been thinking of a program as a collection of tasks that need to be performed in a specific order.
There's nothing wrong with this approach, but it can get cumbersome as a program grows in size and complexity--and it isn't always an intuitive way to plan our programs.

Now we're ready to start our transition to object-oriented programming (OOP), which lets us think about programs the way we think about the world around us.
Instead of thinking about a program as a bunch of tasks, we can think of it as a bunch of objects that interact with each other.
As an example, the old-school video game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man[*Pac-Man*] has the main character (an object) moving around a maze (another object), and avoiding four ghosts (yep, four more objects).

.Pac-Man arcade game, released in 1980 by Namco

If we decide to create Pac-Man, we'll still be using methods, but they won't be the basic building blocks of our programs.
Instead, we'll be organizing our programs into *classes*, which are blueprints--or recipes--for creating *objects*.
A class defines the *attributes* and *behaviors* of the objects--and those are the variables and methods we'll write to create our programs.

****

In OOP, our planning for a program starts by deciding what objects--and therefore, what classes--we'll need in order to implement the functionality we want.
To help organize our thinking, we'll use a tool called a *class diagram*, which gives a visual representation of the classes and their relationships in our program.
The format programmers use for class diagrams is called UML (Unified Modeling Language). 
The UML standards are extensive, but we'll be using a simplified version in this course. 

Consider a program to handle orders at a restaurant. A simple class to represent on person's order might look like this:

.Example of a class diagram for a restaurant order
[plantuml, target="OrderDiagram", format=png]
----
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
class Order {
   -serverName:String
   -tableNumber:int
   -appetizer:String
   -entree:String
   -dessert:String
   -totalPrice:double
   +void sendToKitchen()
   +void printBill()
   +double closeBill()
}
@enduml
----

The top section of the digram has the name of the class, which is `Order`.
The next section is for the attributes of the class--the information the class will store. This example has attributes for the server's name, the table number, the items ordered, and the total price.
The bottom section is for the beahviors of the class, which are the actions the class can perform (or that we can do with the class).
With an order, we might send it to the kitchen, print the bill, or close the bill.

We'll learn more about the symbols and conventions of UML as we go along, but for now the important part is that we can use class diagrams to help us plan our programs--and to talk about OOP concepts without bogging down on code details.

NOTE: Your Canvas course includes access to *Lucid (Whiteboard)*, which is a free online tool you can use to create UML diagrams. If you create your account through the link in the left-hand navbar in Canvas, you'll have access to the premium features for free.

Many programs will have multiple classes, and diagramming those before we start coding helps us work out details and find potential problems.
Diagrams are also useful for sharing information about a class for other programmers who might need to use it.

Classes in and of themselves can't really be used in a program; they're just the blueprints for objects.
To use a class, we create an object--or _instance_--of the class, which is a specific version of the class with its own attributes and behaviors.
A recipe analogy also works here: a class is like a recipe for a cake, and an object is a specific cake made from that recipe.
One class can be used to make as many instances as we need, which is part of what makes OOP so powerful.

In our Pac-Man example, we could create one Ghost class and use it to create all four Ghost objects we'll need in the game.

=== Encapsulation

Object-oriented programming is all about creating objects that can interact with each other.
Since the objects will be interacting, we need to think about how to keep them from interfering with each other in ways we don't want.
If we have an `Order` class in a program used by a restaurant, we don't want some other class to change attributes in a way that disrupts the program--like changing the entree selection to something that's not on the menu, or setting the price to a negative number, for example.

To prevent this kind of tampering, whether it's intention or accidental, OOP relies on a concept called *encapsulation*.
Encapsulation of a class means that attributes are hidden from the outside world, and only the behaviors of the class can access and change them.
As an analogy, consider the counter at a fast food restaurant. You can't just reach over and grab a handful of fries; you have to ask the employee behind the counter to get them for you.
In this analogy, the food is encapsulated and you can only access it by using a behavior, like "order food".

Another way to think of encapsulation is the way we interacte with other people in social situations.
When we encounter a stranger, they don't automatically know our name and phone number; they have to ask us for that information.
We've encapsulated our personal information, and we only share it when and how we choose to.

In Java, encapsulation is not a strict requirement, and our code will still work if we don't use it.
But it's a best practice--and an important one--so we will encapsulate all of our classes in this course.
In fact, I would argue that if you don't encapsulate your classes, you're not really doing object-oriented programming. 
And that's what we're here to learn.

=== Defining and Using a Class

#This section is missing a video and probably has typos, but in the meantime this content is covered in section 4.2 (page 117) through 4.5 in the textbook.#

We'll look at a program to keep rudimentary weather records; for a single day's weather data, we'll have a class called `WeatherRecord`.

.Class diagram for the `WeatherRecord` class
[plantuml, target="WeatherRecordDiagram", format=png]
----
@startuml
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
class WeatherRecord {
   -date:String
   -highTemp:int
   -avgWindspeed:int
   +setDate(String):void
   +setHighTemp(int):void
   +setAvgWindspeed(int):void
   +displayData():void
}
@enduml
----

To implement this class in code, we'll start with a class header. The class header always follows the same pattern: an *access modifier*, the keyword `class`, and the name of the class.
The class header is followed by a code block, enclosed in curly braces.

.`WeatherRecord.java`. A class header and code block. 
[source,java]
----
public class WeatherRecord {

   // class code goes here

}
----

Access modifier:: The `public` keyword means that the class can be accessed from any other class. Though this is technically optional, you should always use `public` for now.
`class` keyword:: The keyword that tells Java we're defining a class. It's required. We'll eventually be able to create different kinds of classes and OOP structures, but for now we're just creating regular classes.
*Class name* (or _identifier_):: The name of the class, which should be a noun that describes the object the class represents--and is singular, so there's no _s_ at the end. The identifier should start with a capital, with the first letter of each word capitalized (like `WeatherRecord`). This is similar to the _camelCase_ naming convention we've been using for variables and methods; it's called _PascalCase_.

The class code block is where we define the different components that make up the class, which we call the *class members*. 
To begin with, we'll focus on two types of class members: *fields* and *methods*.

==== Fields

Fields are the implementation of the attributes of the class.
The are also known as *instance variables* because they similar to the variables we've been using in our programs, but their scope is the object created from the class, not the method where they're defined.
A field is unique to the object; if we make two objects from our `WeatherRecord` class, each object will have its own date, high temperature, and average temperature.
If we change the hig temperature for one object, it won't affect the high temperature for the other object.

Fields are declared like our other variables, but they are encapsulated using the `private` access modifier.
This means that the fields can only be accessed and changed by the methods of the class, not by other classes--which controls how the data is used and prevents accidental or invalid changes.

WARNING: Since a class will compile and run even if we leave off the `private` access modifier, it's easy to forget to use it. But don't worry, I'll help you remember by taking huge points off your assignments if you don't make your fields `private`. As I mentioned, you're not really doing OOP if you don't encapsulate your fields, and we're learning OOP.

Fields are declared at the top of the class using the same naming conventions we've been using for variables: a descriptive name formatted in camelCase.

.`WeatherRecord.java`. Fields added to the `WeatherRecord` class.
[source,java]
----
public class WeatherRecord {
   private String date;
   private int highTemp;
   private int avgTemp;
}
----

In our original class diagram, we indicated that the fields were private by using a `-` in front of the field name.

image::WeatherRecordDiagram.png["Class diagram for the `WeatherRecord` class"]

image::SadPuppy.png["Sad puppy", width=200, float=right] 

You might remember from https://timmcmichael.github.io/skimpy-oop/_0011_methods_chapter_3.html#_variable_scope[the section on variable scope in Chapter 0011] that using global variables is terrible, and every time we create a global variable, a puppy loses one of its toys. 
And these fields look an awful lot like global variables.
But fields in a class are *not* global variables; they're *instance* variables, and they're a good thing.
The fields are *encapsulated*, so they can only be accessed and changed by the methods of the class--which is a good thing.
And the fields are unique to each object, so we can have multiple objects with different values for the fields--which is also a good thing.
And so no puppies toys will be harmed as long as we use *private* fields correctly.

==== Methods

Ensuring that our fields are `private` is the first step in encapsulating our class, but it's not the only step.
We also need to create methods that can access and change the fields--otherwise, the fields are useless.
So far, our methods have included the keyword `static`; we'll learn more about that shortly, but when we make methods for an OOP class, we'll leave off that `static` keyword.
These _nonstatic_ methods are called *instance methods*, and they are otherwise very similar to the `static` methods we've been using.

Though there are exceptions, most of these instance methods will be `public`, so they can be accessed from other classes.
Remember, the foundation of encapsulation is having `private` fields and public methods to to permit interactions with that data.

In broad terms, we can categorize instance methods into two types: *accessor* methods and *mutator* methods.

===== Accessor Methods

Accessor methods give access to the fields of the class, but they don't change the fields.
Think of them as "read only" methods, and often all they do is return the value of a field.
Java naming conventions specify that accessor methods should start with `get` and then the name of the field they access, formatted in camelCase. 
Because of that convention, another name for accessors methods is *getters*.

.Example of an accessor method (or "getter")
[source,java]
----
public int getHighTemperature() {
        return highTemperature;
    }
----

The return type of an accessor method is the same as the type of the field it accesses; in this case `highTemperature` is an `int`, so the return type of our getting is `int`.

A getter allows other classes to be able to read the value of a field; if they don't need to know the value, we just don't write a getter for that field.
But read-only access usually does no harm, so often we'll have getters for all of our fields.

.`WeatherRecord.java`. Getters added to the `WeatherRecord` class.
[source,java]
----
public class WeatherRecord {
   private String date;
   private int highTemp;
   private int avgTemp;

   public String getDate() {
      return date;
   }

   public int getHighTemp() {
      return highTemp;
   }

   public int getAvgTemp() {
      return avgTemp;
   }
   
}
----

===== Mutator Methods

Mutator methods change the fields of the class.
Though they sometimes return a value, their primary purpose is to change the value of a field and they often have a `void` return type.
As we're getting the hang of this OOP thing, we'll create a lot of mutator methods that are just *setters*--methods that set the value of a field.
The naming convention for setters is to start with `set` and then the name of the field they change, formatted in camelCase; they usually have a void return type.

[source,java]
----
public void setHighTemperature(int temp) {
        highTemperature = temp;
    }
----

The parameter of a setter is the same type as the field it changes; in this case `highTemperature` is an `int`, so the parameter of our setter is also an `int`.
All this method does is accept a new value and assign it to the field.

Choosing to write setters isn't quite as straightforward as with getters, where there's generally no harm in exposing read-only access to everything.
But we really should only write setters for fields that we want to be able to change from outside the class.

TIP: As a rule of thumb for beginners, create getters for all of your fields when you first write your class, and then add setters only as you need them. Because this is sometimes tricky for beginners to determine, I don't deduct points for writing unnecessary setters--but sometimes my directions will explicitly tell you not to write a setter for a field, and I do deduct for that.

If you're paaying attention to what we're doing here, you might be thinking that these setters really just give public access to the fields, which seems to go against the whole idea of encapsulation.
That's true for now, but only because we don't know enough Java yet to do anything about it.
As we learn more about Java, we'll be able to write more complex methods that can control *how* fields are changed--for example, by checking the new value to make sure it's valid and won't break anything.
But for now, this is just another one of those frustrating rules that you just have to follow until you know enough to understand it.

.`WeatherRecord.java`. Setters added to the `WeatherRecord` class, and comments identifying the parts.
[source,java]
----
public class WeatherRecord {
    // Fields
    private String date;
    private int highTemperature;
    private double averageWindSpeed;
    
    // Getters
    public String getDate() {
        return date;
    }

    public int getHighTemperature() {
        return highTemperature;
    }

    public double getAverageWindSpeed() {
        return averageWindSpeed;
    }

    // Setters and Mutators
    public void setDate(String date) {
        this.date = date;
    }

    public void setHighTemperature(int highTemperature) {
        this.highTemperature = highTemperature;
    }

    public void setAverageWindSpeed(double averageWindSpeed) {
        this.averageWindSpeed = averageWindSpeed;
    }
}
----

Sometimes mutator methods don't follow the exact pattern and purpose of setters (simply setting a field's value).
For example, a method might perform a series of calculations and changes to multiple fields, or it might change a field based on the value of another field.
These methods are still mutators, and we might even still refer to them as _setters_, but they don't always follow the `setFieldName` naming convention.

==== Using the Class
#This subsection, coming up! See section 4.4 in the book in the meantime.#

As we've learned, defining a class establishes a blueprint; to make use of a class in a program, we need to use that blueprint to create an object. 
We can as many objects from a class as we need, and each object is known as an *instance* of the class.
And creating an instance is called *instantiating* a class.

To create our first objects, we use the same two steps we've been using to create variables: a declaration statement and an assignment statement.
The declaration is still a _data type_ and an _identifier, but in this case the data type is the name of the class:

.Example of a declaration statement for an object.
[source,java]
----
WeatherRecord day1;
----

This creates a variable called `day1` that will point to--or _reference_--the memory location where our object will be stored.
The identifier follows the same rules we learned for primitive variables: a descriptive name typed in camelCase (with a lowercase first letter).
In this case, the `day1` object is going to maintain the record for the first day of our weather tracking.

The assignment statement works the same, but what we're assigning looks a lot different.
We'll use the `new` keyword to allocate memory, and then we'll call a *constructor*.

.Example of an assignment statement for a newly declared object.
[source,java]
----
WeatherRecord day1;
day1 = new WeatherRecord();
----

We're soon going to spend a lot of time learning about constructors, but here are the takeaways for now: the identifier is exactly the same as the class name, and it's followed by parentheses.

NOTE: We've already learned that parentheses in Java *always* means we're referring to a method. A constructor is a special method called when instantiating an object.

Just like with variables, we often combine those two statements into one line of code:

`WeatherRecord day1 = new WeatherRecord();`

Now that we have an object, we can call its instance methods using _dot notation_, which means we put the object name (*not* the class name!), followed by a dot, followed by the method call:

.Instance method calls using dot notation.
[source,java]
----
WeatherRecord day1 = new WeatherRecord();
day1.setHighTemperature(87);
System.out.println("High temperature on day 1:" + day1.getHighTemperature());
----

In this example, we're setting the `highTemperature` field of `day1` to 87 degrees, and then we're retrieving the high temperature and outputting the returned value.
This is a good test of the _set_ and _get_ methods for the `highTemperature` field.

It's easy for beginners to forget to use that dot notation.
To see why it's necessary, consider the following example.

.An instance method call using dot notation with multiple objects.
[source,java]
----
WeatherRecord day1 = new WeatherRecord();
WeatherRecord day2 = new WeatherRecord();

day1.setHighTemperature(87);
----

If we left off the `day1.` part of the call, the compiler would not know which `setHighTemperature()` method to use, `day1` or `day2`.
Even when we only have one instance, the compiler needs to know where to find that method, so the dot notation is required every time we call an instance method.

===== Object Classes vs. Driver Classes

Ok, time for another convention that seems only intended to be nitpicky and pointless, but is important and is expected on assignments in this course.
OOP nerds value keeping parts of our programs compartmentalized, and that includes separating the class definition and the code that uses the class.
A class definition goes in its own file, which must have a filename exactly match the name of the class (with _.java_ as an extension)--and that one's not a convention, that's a syntax rule for the compiler.
A class we definte for use as object can be called an *object class* or a *user-defined class*. 

The code that uses the _object class_ should be in its own file, and is often called a *driver class*.
The driver class contains the `main()` method, which is the entry point for the program.
A driver class actually goes by several different names. 
Some people call it a _main class_ because, well, it's the class with the `main()` method; I don't hear that term a lot, but it is out there.
I often use the terms _demo class_ or _test class_ because, as learners, we're often making a class just to try a specific concept or skill, and the only thing our program really does is show that the object class is working. 
And in those cases, we often see "test" or "demo"; so a driver class for our `WeatherRecord` object class might be called `WeatherRecordDemo` or `TestWeatherRecord`, or something similar.

The point here is that, if we've created an object class called `WeatherRecord`, we're not going to put our `main()` method in that same class/file.
We're going to make a separate class--a driver, or demo class, or test class.
I don't much care what term you use, as long as it's separate.

Your pitchforks are already sharpened, but here's the part where you light your torches.
*All of your input and output should be in the driver class.*
That is, you generally can't have any `print()` or `println()` statements, any dialog popups (if you know how to use `JOptionPane` or similar), or any `Scanner` input calls in your object classes.
My examples always demonstrate this _separation of concerns_, so you'll have plenty of examples of what I mean.

.Interesting!
****
I asked an AI platform to give me an image of an angry mob with pitchforks and torches (coming after me because I make them separate their input and output), and the AI spit out this https://github.com/timmcmichael/skimpy-oop/blob/5c16f73bd0e71a33b94727618d3097f503eb27a6/chapter-4-classes/images/creepy_mob.png?raw=true[nightmare fuel^].
I decided it was too creepy to display in the text, but the crime against nature should be preserved for posterity. If a mob like that comes for me, I'll let them put `print()` statements wherever they want!
****

Why can't we put input/output in our object classes?
* To "decouple" the UI from the _business logic_ or guts of our program. This makes our code reusable in a variety of projects, such as web pages, mobile apps, and GUI applications--none of which are friendly to console input and output. Look up MVC and MVVM for all kinds of information about that.
* To keep our code more readable by keeping the parts clearly identifiable.
* Because I just don't care much about input and output. I care about the classes you create, so I want to look at (and grade) that work separately. If your input and output don't work but your object class looks good, you're still going to get a good grade--if I'm able to separate out those mistakes.

Unfortunately, this is one of those things that boils down to, "because I said so" and "you'll thank me later."
Sorry, I can't do much better than that for now.

.`WeatherRecordDemo.java`. A driver class to demonstrate the `WeatherRecord` class.
[source,java]
----
public class WeatherRecordDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Instantiate two objects
        WeatherRecord day1 = new WeatherRecord();
        WeatherRecord day2 = new WeatherRecord();

        // Set field values for both instances
        day1.setDate("2024-10-01");
        day1.setHighTemperature(87);
        day1.setAverageWindSpeed(1.5);

        day2.setDate("2024-10-02");
        day2.setHighTemperature(75);
        day2.setAverageWindSpeed(8.25);

        // Output field values for both instances
        System.out.println("Date: " + day1.getDate());
        System.out.println("High Temperature: " + day1.getHighTemperature());
        System.out.println("Average Wind Speed: " + day1.getAverageWindSpeed());

        System.out.println("------------------------------");

        System.out.println("Date: " + day2.getDate());
        System.out.println("High Temperature: " + day2.getHighTemperature());
        System.out.println("Average Wind Speed: " + day2.getAverageWindSpeed());
    }
}
----

The driver class above creates two instances of the `WeatherRecord` class, uses each setter, then outputs the return from each getter.
This ensures that instance variables are independent of each other and all instance methods work correctly.
In general, I ask students to create at least two instances of each class they are demonstrating.
