# 4A - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

You're old enough now that we need to have The Talk. You're probably starting to have strange feelings when you notice a method. Maybe you have variables appearing in places you've never noticed variables before.

The truth is, you're getting too mature to simply think about your programs from a procedural perspective. You need to start learning about object-oriented programming. 

This video is here to help. Learn about classes and objects, and how attributes and behaviors become fields and methods.

# 4B - Designing an OOP Class

Buckle up! We're going to take a look at a real live class, just like what you'll have to do on assignments. What's the matter--you scared? Don't worry, we'll get through this together. 

This quick video walks through the design of an object class for a simple program. We'll discuss the UML diagram, including fields and methods. The next video in the series will show how to implement the class in Java.

# 4C - Implementing an OOP Class in Java

Ugh, there's nothing worse than taking a college programming class and finding out the professor just wants to make you draw pretty little class diagrams, amiright? Does our course fee cover crayons? Time to put your foot down and demand some real programming!

In this video, we'll take the amazing cell phone customer class from the previous video and implement it in Java. We'll create a new class, write the fields and methods, and then test it out in a simple driver class.

The previous video (sans crayons) is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcdLgbwtYdc&list=PL_Lc2HVYD16Y-vLXkIgggjYrSdF5DEFnU&index=13
The class from this video is further developed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHxssPU1_Hw&list=PL_Lc2HVYD16Y-vLXkIgggjYrSdF5DEFnU&index=15

0:00 Intro
0:47 Fields and Getters
2:56 Setters
4:52 Creating a Driver Class
10:33 Using Set Methods
12:21 Mutator Methods
14:58 Outro

# 4D - Constructors

Setters are great, but they just require So. Much. Typing. My precious little fingers can hardly take it! I just wish there was a way to jam all the values I want into an object at once.

Constructors, to the rescue! Learn how a default constructor initializes an object when we don't create a constructor of your own. Then, learn how to create a constructor of your own. You'll have so much fun making a constructor that you'll then learn to override it so you can have even more fun!

This video builds on a class created here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0HFACqWgP4&list=PL_Lc2HVYD16Y-vLXkIgggjYrSdF5DEFnU&index=14

0:56 Default Constructors
1:56 Defining a Parameterless Constructor
3:03 Adding Parameters to a Constructor
5:33 Improving Encapsulation
6:35 Overloading Constructors
7:45 Outro
