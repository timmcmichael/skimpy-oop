== Stuff That's Tacked on the End

=== Answers to _Check Your Learning_ questions

==== Getting Started Chapter

[qanda]
What does JDK stand for?::
Java Development Kit

What is an example of an Integrated Development Environment?::
Visual Studio Code, eclipse, IntelliJ, and many others.

==== Computers and Coding (Chapter 1)

[qanda]
What tool converts your programming into something the computer can run?::
A compiler (or, in some cases, interpreter)

What is the name of the instruction set, specific to each computer type, that a computer can understand and execute?::
Machine language

What are some advantages of using an organized software development process?::
Keeps you focused, breaks up a complicated problem/program, etc.

What programming paradigm bundles procedures with the data they use?::
Object-oriented programming (OOP)

==== Variables (Chapter 2)

[qanda]
Explain the difference between a declaration and an assignment.::
A declaration sets aside a memory location for a variable; an assignment puts a value in a variable.

Identify a data type you could use for each of the following::
+
--
*A complete mailing address* `String`, since it is a collection of characters, including numbers, letters, and punctuation.

*A speed limit:* `int`, since it is a whole number.

*The average number of students in classes at EMCC:* `double`, since the value may include decimals.
--

What kind of object can you use to get keyboard input from the user?:: An object of the `Scanner` class.

==== Methods (Chapter 3)
[qanda]
What is the main purpose of using methods in Java, and how do they contribute to code maintainability?::
The main purpose of using methods in Java is to organize code into reusable blocks that perform specific tasks. Methods help in breaking down complex programs into smaller, manageable pieces, making the code easier to read, understand, and maintain. By encapsulating functionality within methods, changes can be made in one place without affecting other parts of the program. This improves maintainability because if a bug is found or a change is needed, it can be addressed within the method itself, rather than having to update multiple instances of the same code throughout the program.

Explain the difference between a parameter and an argument in the context of Java methods. Provide an example to illustrate your explanation.::
In Java, a parameter is a variable defined in the method declaration that acts as a placeholder for the value that will be passed to the method. An argument, on the other hand, is the actual value that is passed to the method when it is called. For example, in the method definition `public static void printArea(double radius)`, `radius` is a parameter. When the method is called with `printArea(5.0)`, the value `5.0` is the argument passed to the method.

Why is it generally better to return values from methods rather than printing them directly within the method? How does this practice improve the modularity and reusability of code?::
It is generally better to return values from methods rather than printing them directly within the method because returning values allows the method to be more versatile and reusable. When a method returns a value, it can be used in various contexts, such as in calculations, assignments, or further processing, without being tied to a specific output format. This practice improves modularity by keeping the method focused on a single task (e.g., performing a calculation) and leaving the decision of how to use the result to the calling code. It also enhances reusability, as the method can be used in different parts of the program or even in different programs without modification.
