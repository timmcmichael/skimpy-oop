Setters are great, but they just require So. Much. Typing. My precious little fingers can hardly take it! I just wish there was a way to jam all the values I want into an object at once.

Constructors, to the rescue! Learn how a default constructor initializes an object when we don't create a constructor of your own. Then, learn how to create a constructor of your own. You'll have so much fun making a constructor that you'll then learn to override it so you can have even more fun!

Buckle up! We're going to take a look at a real live class, just like what you'll have to do on assignments. What's the matter--you scared? Don't worry, we'll get through this together. 

This quick video walks through the design of an object class for a simple program. We'll discuss the UML diagram, including fields and methods. The next video in the series will show how to implement the class in Java.

Ugh, there's nothing worse than taking a college programming class and findint out the professor just wants to make you draw pretty little class diagrams, amiright? Does our course fee cover crayons? Time to put your food down and demand some real programming!

In this video, we'll take the amazing cell phone customer class from the previous video and implement it in Java. We'll create a new class, write the fields and methods, and then test it out in a simple driver class.

The previous video (sans crayons) is here: https://youtu.be/xcdLgbwtYdc
