=== What's the Point?
* Know how to select a data type
* Write code to declare variables and assign values
* Do some basic math

'''
It's fun to create programs that display stuff on the screen, but that's pretty limited.
To start doing things that are more interesting--and useful--we'll need to keep track of some information.
In computer programming, a piece of information is called *data*.

In broad terms, there are two kinds of data:
[unordered]
constant:: A piece of data that can't change during program execution.
variable:: A piece of data that may change (or "vary") during program execution.

In our `Hello World` code, the letters and characters we output are _constant_ data.

.HelloWorld.java
[source,java]
----
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // <.>

    }

}
----
<.> The string literal "Hello World"

The only way to change what's output is by editing that constant--in the quotation marks--in our source code, before we run the program.

NOTE: The string literal in our `Hello World` code is just one kind of constant. We'll learn about others later.

In order for our programs to be flexible and responsive, we'll need *variables*.
I encourage beginning students to think of a variable like a container, such as a cup.

// TODO: Take a picture of the Nerds Rule mug and add it here

The container can hold one thing at a time.
I can put coffee in it, or I can put water in it--but I can't put both.
If I start with coffee and decide I want to put water in there, the coffee gets dumped out and is gone forever.
That's fine, but I better make sure I don't want the coffee anymore before I put something else in the mug.

A variable works the same way.
It can hold one value, and that value can vary--remember, that's where the name comes from--but once it's changed, that old value is lost.

I guess I could mix coffee and water, but then that's really a new substance and I can't get back my plain coffee (or my water).
If I want to store coffee *and* water, I can do that by using two different containers. 

From a programming perspective--rather than a coffee perspective--a variable is a location in the computer's memory where we can store a value.
In order to use that value, we have to know where to find it, so we give the memory location a name, technically called an *identifier*.

And the computer will need to know how much memory to set aside for that variable, which depends on the kinds of values we want to store. 
Storing the number 7 doesn't take very much space; storing a picture of John Elway takes a lot more space.
The *type* of data we can store in a variable is called its

..._drumroll_, please...

*data type*.

Reserving a memory location by specifying a data type and identifier is known as *declaring* a variable.
Placing data in that variable is referred to as *assigning* a value to a variable.

NOTE: If you have programming experience in Python or JavaScript, the idea of a data type might be new to you. In those languages, the interpreter determines the data type for you--so you don't have to specify it. It's one reason I prefer to teach beginners using Java, which teaches you how data types work.

==== Java Identifiers
Variable names (more properly called variable _identifiers_) are the character sequences that identify a variable.
There are a few rules that determine whether or not an identifier is valid:
* The first character much be an uppercase or lowercase letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).

In addition to those technical rules about identifier names, the convention in Java is to use descriptive names in "camel case" format, as described in the preceding video. 
Single-letter variable names, like `x` for a number, are fine in your math class, but is generally *not* okay when you're coding.
The expectation in my course is that your code will align with those conventions--because that's what industry people expect--and you will lose points if you don't.

=== Numeric Data Types

Variables for storing numbers come in two flavors: *integers* and *floating point* numbers.
As you may remember from your math class, an integer is a whole number; that is, a number that doesn't include any decimal places or fractional values. 
5 is an integer, -824 is an integer, while 3.14 and 7 1/2 are not.

A floating point number includes decimals, so 3.14 can be stored as a floating point number. 
7 1/2 can also be stored as a floating point number, but only as a decimal (i.e., 7.5).

The most common numeric data types in Java are `int` for integers and `double` for floating point numbers.
You can get pretty far in programming just using those two, and in courses I teach you won't need to use any other numeric data types--but others do exist.

Other data types for integers are `byte`, `short`, and `long`.
These different types exist because they use different amounts of memory. `byte` and `short` are smaller than `int`, while `long` is larger.
The impact of these different memory sizes (or memory *allocations*) is that the types can store values of different sizes.
For example, a `byte` uses 8 bits of memory and can store a number between -128 and 127 (inclusive), while an `int` takes 32 bits and can store a value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 (inclusive).

.Interesting
****
This all goes back to binary numbers. An 8-bit number has 8 digits, and we use the first digit to specify whether the number is positive or negative. That leaves 7 digits, and we can make 128 different combinations of 1s and 0s in 7 digits: `0000000`, `0000001`, `0000002`, and so on, all the way up to `1111111`. Those 128 possibilities give us the `byte` range of -128 to 127 (keeping in mind that we do need one of those combinations to represent zero).
****

The other floating point data type in Java is called `float`. 
It's called "single" in some programming languages, which helps understand where the name `double` comes from: `double` uses twice as much memory (64 bits) as a `float` or "single" (32 bits)--and therefore its range of values is twice as big. Be aware that to make a `float` number in Java, you have to add the letter F (in capital or lowercase form) at the end of the number.
[source,java]
----
float myGPA = 3.75f; // <.>
double myFriendsGPA = 3.54;
----
<.> The `f` suffix denotes that the value 3.75 is a `float` rather than a `double`.

==== Who Cares About Memory Size?
The general rule in programming is to be as efficient with your resources (memory, storage, processing speed, network bandwidth, etc.) as possible.
If you're storing a person's age, you don't really need an `int`; nobody is going to be two million years old!
A `byte` has plenty of room (up to 127) to store even the oldest person's age, and it uses a fraction of the memory.
So I should be telling you to use a `byte` in this case.

But I don't worry about that with beginning programmers for two reasons.
First, it's hard enough for a beginner to write programs that work--so instead of asking you to deal with _all_ of the integer types, I just have you use `int` whenever you need a whole number, and `double` when you need something with a decimal.
Second, these days even the wimpiest computer has waaaaaay more RAM than is needed by even the most complex program a beginner will write, so we don't need to worry about it.

But understand that this attitude is only a teaching and learning aid.
It's like saying we shouldn't worry about the price of groceries because we have plenty of money.
That might be true, but it's good to be careful with your money--and it's irresponsible of me to tell you to just waste your money.

As you get more comfortable with programming, use your memory resources efficiently.
While you're learning, just worry about getting your code to work.

NOTE: There's another bad data type practice that I use with beginners. 
Floating point numbers aren't 100% precise, for reasons that are too nerdy even for us right now. 
Because of that precision problem, we should never use `float` or `double` for something like money/currency. Instead, Java has something called `BigDecimal`. 
But this is another place where I value simplicity for beginners, so we just use double for stuff like prices and account balances in our code. 
Just know that you'll get fired if you do that at your job with the bank.

=== `boolean` Data Type (and Boolean Logic)
A `boolean` variable has only two possible values: `true` and `false`.
It's useful for tracking information that is only one thing or the other. 
_Am I passing this class?_
The answer to that is either `true` or `false`--there is no other possibility.
_Does Julia own a car?_
Again, only two possible answers to that question; she either owns one or she doesn't.

The best practice is to name a `boolean` variable in a way that expresses this either/or state.
That is to say, we usually name our `boolean` variables using words like _is_, _has_, _can_, and so on.

[source,java]
----
boolean isPassing = true;
boolean hasCar = false;
----

`boolean` variables go hand-in-hand with _Boolean expressions_ which are statements that evaluate to be either `true` or `false`, like those questions above.

// TODO: Link to chapter on decisions re: boolean logic

=== `char` Data Type
If you want to store a single character, like a student's letter grade or their first initial, you can use the `char` data type.
Char literals are created by putting a character in single quotes, and that character can be a letter, number, punctuation mark or symbol--or some other weird stuff, too.
[source,java]
----
char myLetterGrade = 'A';
----

NOTE: Some people pronounce the `char` data type like the word "chart" without the "t". And some people pronounce it like the word "care". Either is okay. 

NOTE: I pronounce it "char" like "chart" without the "t" and firmly believe that only a sociopath would say it like the word "care".

A `char` is really just an integer, but the number it holds conforms to a standard list of character values called *ASCII* (with the fun pronounciation "Ass key").
In this standard, the number 65 is a capital 'A', 66 is 'B', and so on.
Lowercase letters are considered different characters, so 97 is 'a' and 98 is 'b'. Check out the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Table_of_codes[complete ASCII table] if you're curious.

=== Strings
A `char` is pretty limited since it can only hold a single character.
If we want to put a collection of characters together to make words and sentences, we need multiple ``char``s grouped into a single variable.
That data type is called `String`, because it strings together a bunch of ``char``s, like a string of holiday lights.

.A `String` variable is multiple ``char``s strung together like a set of lights.
image::string_of_lights.png[A string of holiday lights]

A `String` is different from the other data types we've looked at so far.
The types we've seen so far are *primitive data types*, and `String` is what's called a *reference data type* (though some folks might prefer the more generic "non-primitive data type"). 
Primitives are stored differently in memory, and they are not _objects_--which we'll learn more about later.
For now, a really important thing to notice and remember is that primitive types start with a lowercase letter (`int`, `double`, etc.) and reference types start with a capital letter: so you have to remember to type `String` with a capital S.

`String` literals are denoted with double quotation marks.
[source, java]
----
String address = "3000 N. Dysart Road";
String bestClass = "CIS150AB";
----

Strings are really important and there's all kinds of fun and useful stuff we can do with them, but we'll need to save all of that for later while we stay focused on the basics.

NOTE: Always remember that, in Java, single quotes mean a `char` and double quotes mean a `String`. It's easy to get them mixed up--especially if you use Python, where they are interchangeable--but your code won't compile if you mix them up.


=== Math Calculations
// TODO: Section on arthmetic operators
In order to start doing some calculations, we'll be using _operators_.
You can think of an operator as a symbol that performs a calculation or other task.
You've been using an operator already: the _assignment operator_, which uses the `=` symbol.
To do basic math calculations, there are five arithmetic operators in Java:

.Java arithmetic operators
[%header, stripes=even, %autowidth]
|===
|Operator |Description
| +
| Addition
| -
| Subtraction
| * 
| Multiplication
| /
| Division (quotient)
| %
| Modulo (remainder)
|===

The arithmetic operators work pretty much the way you'd expect, except maybe _modulo_--which might be a term you've never heard before. 
Each operator acts on the value to either side:

[source,java]
----
int sum = 5 + 7; // <.> 
int difference = sum - 2; // <.>
----
<.> The value of `sum` will be 12
<.> The value of `difference` will be 10 (i.e., 10 - 2)
