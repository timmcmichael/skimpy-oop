we're going to jump right into an  example of using swing to create a  program that does some kind of a  calculation this is going to be a short  video because we're not really learning  anything new there there might be one  little piece of this that you haven't  seen before but mostly this is about  taking what we've learned about swing so  far and applying it in a little more  real world kind of an example because  when we first start out we're often  learning to how to put a message on the  screen or something like that so in this  program we're going to take some input  from the user we're going to perform  some calculations with it and we're  going to Output the result on the  guey let's take a look at the guey I  have set up for us it's really simple  really straightforward this is going to  ask the user to enter the amount of they  spent on food the amount they spent on  drinks we have a check box for the  amount for adding a 20% tip and then  we're going to calculate the total price  pretty straightforward as always we will  begin with our import statements I do  need to add that awt event package at  the top and now that I have that I can  add on my interface to this so I'm going  to say  implements action  listener right and as we've seen once we  add that implementation of action  listener we're going to start getting an  error because the action listener  interface requires us to have a method  called action  performed and so I'm going to not be  able to compile until I put that in  place I'm going to scroll down I've  still got this main method down at the  bottom I've talked about that a few  times I don't really like that it should  be in a different program as far as I'm  concerned uh but I want to keep  everything on one screen for the the  sake of the  recording but I do need to create this  uh method this action listener uh action  performed excuse  me and I don't  actually remember the exact um method  signature here if you remember in a  previous video I just let Visual Studio  code create this for me but I think I  can figure this out I think I remember  um it takes an action event  uh object as a as an argument here and I  think that's yep that got rid of our  error I really should these really are  overrides when we're doing that so I'm  going to add that override uh compiler  directive kind of late for that I've  already figured out um how to do it  correctly and here's where I'm going to  do my calculations inside this event  handler and so we've got uh two text  fields we need to work with we've got  the price of the food and the price of  the drinks and then we've got a checkbox  that we need to deal with and the first  Retrieving and converting JTextField values  text field or text box that I'm going to  work with I'm going to break it up into  a couple different lines of code uh to  make sure it's really clear exactly what  we're doing and on the second one I'll  combine them in the way that most people  would normally write them so what I'm  going to do with that first text field  is I need to get whatever text is in  there and I'm just going to save that in  a string variable called  input so I'm going to call this dot text  food.  gettext and we've seen this before right  this um the get text method is going to  return a string and so that's why I need  a string to store that but as long as  it's a string I can't do any math with  it I need to convert it to some type of  numeric data and this is the part that  you may or may not have seen before um I  need to convert that string into a  double and so I'm going to make a  double  called food  price and I'm going to use the double  class and now since I'm talking about  the class that's going to be a capital D  and then it has a method called parse  double and parsing is a is a phrase that  is a term that means kind of taking  something apart and so this is going to  take apart a string and it's going to  return a double based on that string if  it  can  and that should get us our uh input and  convert it to a double I say it should  but I haven't tested it yet and so one  of the challenges that comes up with a  guey uh program is how do we test it and  make sure everything's working correctly  I personally probably would use some of  the debugging Tools in VSS code but we  still do have the oldfashioned way which  is to use a system out print line  statement and so I'm going to say that  the food  oops the price of the  food is going to  be food price and I can still output to  the terminal in that way the user if  they're running the program kind of as  an end user they're not going to see  that but I as the developer can still do  that and make sure everything's working  okay so I'm going to test this and make  sure that it prints out my food price  correctly okay so I'm just going to put  in  $999 and I'm going to hit calculate and  nothing has happened so I have to figure  out what's going on uh it looks like  because I have this print line statement  it looks like this action performed is  not actually executing and the reason is  because I I've skipped a step and I  warned you in one of my other videos  that it's a step that I often forget and  you need to in addition to writing your  event handler code you have to attach  that uh that listener to the the widget  that's going to be um producing the  event right so in our case I have a  button that's called BTN Cal and we need  to keep an eye on that for a button  click  so I'm going to add an action listener  and as a reminder it takes um as a  parameter it takes the object where it  can find this this action performed uh  code this essentially this this object  that implements action listener and uh  We've written it in the same class here  so it's going to be this let's run that  again and see if that gets us at least  executing that event handler  okay so I'm going to type  999 click my button and it has output  food equals  9.99 so my code's working so far now  that I've got that um that action  listener attached to my button there and  I don't really need that system out  print line anymore I'm going to leave it  there as long as I'm debugging and then  when I'm all done I'll clean all that up  so what I've done is I took the text  from that text field I saved it as a  string and then I used this double class  to convert that to a double now this  isn't foolproof it's pretty easy to use  but it does have a potential flaw and  that is um it goes back to my Golden  Rule of programming which is that users  are dumb and if I ask somebody to enter  the price of food somebody's going to  come along and type  blue that causes a big problem with our  code causes essentially a crash that the  code in this gooey environment is still  running um but I'm going to stop that  this has caused an exception because you  can't convert blue into a double or at  least the parse double method doesn't  know how to do that uh we can write uh  kind of exception handling to deal with  that if you know how to do that that's  beyond the scope of what we're doing  right now so we're just going to live  with this flaw which is that if the user  does something dumb it might cause our  program to break  Streamlining the retrieval  but I've got this two-step process right  I've gotten the text and I've converted  it to a double and for the other text  box I'm going to combine those into one  step which is the way most people would  write this once they have the hang of it  so I'm going to make a double called um  drink  price and I'm going to say it's equal to  double  um parse double and now the input is  going to be the output of the or the  return of the get text method method so  this. txt  drink. get  text and I think that's correct but once  again I'm going to confirm that with a  simple little output statement  here and I'm just going to run that and  see how it's working and so I need to  make sure I put different numbers in  these two text boxes here so I'm going  to put $999 and I'm going to put  $4.99 and I do get output that says that  those are converting correctly it's kind  of downhill from here I am going to need  a double for the total price and that is  going to be the food Price Plus the  drink Price Right pretty straightforward  I haven't dealt yet with the tip but I  Outputting results to a JLabel  can come back to that and and I can  output my result now we've seen this  before how do we change the text of a  label so this is really the same thing  the only difference now is that the what  I'm outputting happens to be the result  of some math but I've got um this. lbl  result is the name of my label and I'm  going to call the set text method this  time and I'm going to set it to say  total  price and I'll put a dollar sign there  I'm not really formatting this and so um  we it's not going to look as pretty as I  uh as we might want it to look but um  but this should work and it should free  us up from needing these um these print  line statements so let's go ahead and  run this version of the  code and I'm just going to go with real  simple numbers here I'm going to say  five and  two and it has output 7.0 so it does  seem to be working the only bit that's  Getting the status of a JCheckBox  left is the tip and like I did before  I'm going to deal with the tip kind of  in separate steps even though I could  combine them so I'm going to I'll just  get that right here I'm going to create  a Boolean variable and I'm going to call  it add tip as in are we going to add a  tip and to get a value for that I'm  going to go to the the chk tip control  which is my uh checkbox and it has a  method called is  selected and it returns a Boolean if the  box is checked it returns true if the  box is not checked it returned false  there is no other possible outcome uh  other than those two things so that  should give me a true or false U that  indicates whether or not I need to add a  tip and now it's just an if statement so  if add tip then uh the math here is  nothing special I I intentionally made  it pretty easy I'm just going to say um  times equals in other words I'm going to  multiply the total times  1.2 which is um  120% right so it's the full value of the  total plus 20% for the tip um I don't  think there's anything too fancy about  that math and I believe that's going to  get us um a correct calculation so on my  test cases I didn't take the time to to  write out test cases ahead of time uh  but I'm going to put in um $2 and $8  which conveniently gives me $10 and now  I'm going to add the tip which should be  um $2 right 20% of 10 should be two so  now the total is  $12 so this is working pretty well I  guess I don't really have to delete  these print line statements but I really  should if I'm writing a goey program I  don't want things getting dumped into  that terminal um depending on the  environment it's running in it's not  likely to cause a problem but it's sort  of sloppy right so with those two things  cleaned up this now is complete all I've  done is I've uh created my event handler  and I've done all of my math in that  event handler and I have output the  result to a label that's on my guey so  this gives you a nice uh simple  straightforward example of how you can  make your program a little more  realistic uh and More in line with the  kind of things you're going to be asked  to do on assignments and depending on  what I've assigned to you in this uh in  this semester you probably are ready to  go off and do at least some of those  assignments with just this knowledge we  although we will add on a couple things  uh before we wrap up with swing
