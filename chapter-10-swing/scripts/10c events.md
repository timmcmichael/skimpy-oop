before we can bring our goys to life and  make them respond to the user we need to  do a little housekeeping we're going to  take our basic understanding of Swing  widgets and reorganize our guey in a  more objectoriented way instead of  dumping all our widgets in our main  method we can extend the jframe class  and treat our gooey window like an  object with this approach our widgets  are fields or instance variables of our  frame and our Constructor can set up the  frame instantiate the widgets and add  them to the frames layout this approach  gives us the ability to instantiate from  our class multiple times giving us  multiple windows to use in our  application more importantly for the  time being it's going to make it a  little easier when it's time to start  dealing with events here's how a more  object-oriented guey this program is  going to use a gooey to get the name of  the user and then display a simple  personalized greeting and before I  forget we do need to have those same two  import statements that we've uh been  using previously so from java X we need  the swing package and from java we need  a WT which is abstract window toolkit  it's not something I go deep into but uh  we're going to have a couple references  there that will uh will come from  awt the whole whole idea here is that we  want to start using inheritance and kind  of an oish approach so my class is  called greeting frame because it is  going to extend uh the jframe class so  this is going to be the frame that we  use as the the basis of our guey and our  fields in this kind of objectoriented  approach is going to be where we put our  widgets so uh I'm going to start out by  just declaring what all of my uh widgets  are and so I'm going to start with I'm  going to need a couple of labels I will  need a um a prompt for the user to tell  them what they are typing in right so  that's going to be a label that says hey  put in your name and what we've done in  the past is we've sort of just gone  right ahead and then instantiated that  there is absolutely nothing wrong with  doing that um and a lot of people would  do it that way I'm going to just try and  be consistent with my previous lessons  on oop where at the top of my class I  just declare my variables and I declare  them as private because they are fields  and uh I'm going to  then you know essentially set values to  them or instantiate them in the  Constructor just like I do with any  other class that I develop uh and so I'm  going to put both my my labels here on  one line since I'm doing it that way the  other label I'm going to need is at the  uh at the end when they're done I need a  label to display that  greeting next up I'm going to need a  text field or I call him a text box but  the class in swing is J text field uh  and I'm now using this prefix naming  convention here right so uh the the  label that tells the user hey type in  your name is called lbl name well that  gets paired up with a text field that  goes with it right the prompt is  referring to what they type in this text  field and so this prefix naming  convention lets me kind of use the same  root name but say lbl for the label and  txt for the text field so um that's one  of the reasons I like this approach  again the the specific naming convention  doesn't much  matter and the other piece we're going  to need is a button for the user to  click on when it's done uh we could  incidentally make it so they just hit  enter or something like that but we're  going to keep it simple uh so that's  going to button  submit so I've got those  three Fields or you know instance  variables I always call them that are  going to be our  widgets again in an object-oriented  class we are going to use a  Constructor to essentially set values to  all of those Widgets or or  fields and the first thing we did in our  old approach was we set the title of our  frame in our Constructor and so I guess  I could ask for that here but what I'm  going to do partly to remind you that  you have this option is I'm just going  to call the superclass Constructor and  I'm going to pass in my title that  way now I don't have to do it that way  because there is also a the frame jframe  excuse me class has a set title method  so I could also just do it that way but  um I'll do it then with the super super  class Constructor  call and the next thing I'm going to do  is I'm going to kind of configure the  way my Frame Works and so the one I  always forget is set default close  operation for some reason I never  remember to get that right and it's  really annoying if you forget because I  just click the the Red X to close it  when I when I test it and then it's  still running in the background so  jframe do exit on close should give me  the behavior I want um and now the next  thing I want to do is set the size so  remember um before I was saying frame.  set size well that was because frame was  an object that I had just created but  now this is the frame this class is the  frame and so that's why I'm referring to  this dot uh for that the this dot is um  is optional but I like to to use it and  that's part of the reason why is to be  consistent where before we were saying  frame dot now we're going to say this  dot uh so I'm going to set size I'm  going to set it to uh 300  by 200 and the only reason I know that  is because I fiddled with it before I  started recording so that I would know  roughly what size I want it and then I  have to give it a layout man manager set  layout and I'm going to use flow layout  which I think is the only one I've even  talked about at this point so that it  knows how to arrange these widgets when  I start adding them to the  frame with my with  my frame kind of set up and ready to go  I actually could um could start running  it and testing it and so here's where  I'm going to break from the way I  normally do things so normally when I'm  teaching object-oriented programming I  would go create a separate file that  would be like my program with a main  method and it would instantiate a  greeting frame object and uh and go from  there this video I'm going to be showing  you a handful of different things that  we haven't really talked much about  before so I I'm trying to keep it as  simple as possible and only for that  reason I am going to put my main method  inside this greeting frame class and it  um it makes me want to take a shower  because this is just not the way that I  normally do it I I believe pretty firmly  that we should have a separate program  for this but um for the sake of your  learning here and making it easy I'm  going to just do it right here so I'm  going to um in declare and instantiate  my uh my object here so this is going to  be a oops it's not going to be a gooey  it's going to be a greeting  frame and I'll just call it frame since  that was the wording we used before  equals new greeting frame and uh if I  run this it will execute but I'll save  you the suspense I have forgotten  haven't forgotten but uh normally up  here we would also set this to be  visible after we're done adding all of  those things I'm going to save that for  when I'm done with my Constructor I'm  going to say frame do  set visible to  true and I think I should be able to run  this and see my goey so  far which is not going to be much of a  gooey uh it's just my window set to the  size that I wanted it's got a FL  a flow layout set up there and it should  close when I uh when I click the red X  but um as I always say I don't like to  go along without testing my program and  honestly we're pretty much done with our  um with our main method at least for a  long time so I'm going to fold that up  and get it out of the  way and head back to my Constructor so  the next thing I'm going to do now is um  is configure my widgets so first up is  my uh label called lbl name now remember  in the in the other way we we sort of  combined all into one statement and we  said J label um lbl name we're not doing  that anymore if I put J label it's going  to try and make a new J label with this  same name so U now this is already an  instance variable so I'm going to say  this. lbl name equals new jlabel and  then I'm going to put the text that I  want which is just a prompt to say enter  your  name next up for the user is uh that  prompt goes along with a text field so  this. txt name and again I just like  that those kind of go together and sorry  for the quick cut there my dog started  barking so this is going to be a j text  field now in the Constructor call here I  could um I could specify some text uh so  you know I could put a default value  essentially and and that would be fine  it would display that and then the user  will be able to just type over it but  I'm going to leave it just blank for  now next up is our  button new J button I will just make  that say  submit not very creative and then last  but not least is our uh our outputs  label at the bottom where where we're  going to um output our message now  problem here is I don't know what my  message is so I can't put anything there  um I could put some placeholder text in  there and it would display um I could  even put some placeholder text there and  then make it invisible uh so that the  user doesn't see it but the easiest  thing is just to leave that empty  another one that I always forget is I  have to add these widgets to my frame  and previously we would have said frame.  add but remember we are in the frame  object now because that's what we are  what we are uh working on here so frame.  add instead is going to be this do add  and Order counts right  um so uh the flow layout puts them in  the correct order for us so first is  going to be the label and then is going  to be this dot txt  name I'm guessing most of you aren't  bothering with be this dot nonsense but  I don't think it's nonsense and it's my  video so I can do whatever I want so  then is the button and then this  dot lbl greeting I think that is all of  our  controls let's go ahead and run that  Setting the size of a widget  again okay we're looking pretty good but  we have a couple of problems one of them  we can see and one of them we can't uh  they are related to each other this  little thing there is my text box I  think I can type type in there you can't  see that but I think it's accepting my  input um problem is the user has no idea  what they're typing they may not even  recognize that as a text box and and  know that they can type there uh what  happens is the flow layout manager is  going to make everything as compact as  possible so when I give the text to a  label it makes it exactly this size it  doesn't leave Extra Space same thing  with our text field since I left it  empty it says oh it doesn't need any  room so I'll squish it down we need to  address  that so I could like I said I could put  some kind of default text in there and I  could just make it really wide right  that would uh that would do it but then  I would have that ugly text up there and  I have to make it visible and invisible  and stuff like that um what I want to do  instead is tell the layout manager the  size that I want this text field to be  and so um it's similar to what we did up  here with the the frame itself but with  a layout manager like this we can't  specify the exact size what we can do  instead is I can say this. txt name. set  preferred size and what I can do is say  this is what I would like it to be there  incidentally I could also say set  minimum size and the the layout manager  will try to accommodate that but if it  can't because there's too much other  stuff going on or too much in the way it  might not actually respect this request  um but the um the set preferred size  method doesn't take just a pair of  numbers it takes something called a  dimension object and so that's where  we're going to put our two numbers and  the only reason I know to make this 250  by 25 again is I sort of played around  with some layout before I hit record and  so I think that's going to look about  the size that we want now I said there  was also a problem we couldn't see this  was one we could see uh the J label has  the same size issue right when it um  when it compressed everything to make it  efficient or um as small as possible as  compact as possible that J label was  empty so it's there's a j label there  but it's just teeny tiny and I need that  to be there so that when I put a  greeting it will display because the  behavior here if I change the text of  that label it doesn't sort of re uh  recalculate and redraw the size unless I  tell it to and that's just a pain in the  neck so I'm just going to do the same  thing I'm going to set a preferred size  for my greeting  label and I'll just use the same  Dimension I did uh up above 250 by 25  and I think that'll look all right let's  go ahead and run this and see how it  looks  now there we go you just have to trust  me that the the label is there I guess  you don't have to trust me I can I can  prove it I can bring receipts right  right there we go there's my label um  but it looks a lot nicer to the user if  it doesn't have that information there  all right so this is a a good enough  basic guey for the the program that we  are creating here and you may be  thinking well we haven't really  accomplished much right I could have  very easily written this same thing in  our old way of doing it just put it all  in the main method right um so I'm going  to remind you that again my purpose here  is to teach objectoriented programming  so it's important to me that we're uh  we're writing this in kind of an oop  manner so that's one thing um this does  have a couple of other effects one of  them is if I wanted to I could come down  to my main method which really should be  in a different class if you ask me but  um but I could make multiple instances I  could have a frame two and then I could  set them both visible and they'd both be  on the same uh on the screen at the same  time or I could make one visible and  then make the other pop up when the  first one closed or something like that  it's doesn't help us in this particular  program but it could be useful other  times more to the point though this is  going to help us this um object-oriented  approach where we are extending jframe  it's going to help us with the next  topic we turn our attention  to Let's revisit the idea of  Event-driven Programming introduction  event-driven programming in the context  of a guey the program is going to render  the window and the widgets and then it  will wait until the user does something  those some things that the user does are  are called events and some of them are  really obvious like clicking a button or  checking a box but there are all kinds  of other events every time the mouse  moves that's an event hovering over a  widget is an event typing in a text  field is an event and so on so these  events are happening constantly while  the guey is active as developers our job  is to decide which events to respond to  and exactly what those responses are  maybe the program doesn't need to do  anything when the user is just moving  the cursor around but if they click that  button the user expects something to  happen the mechanism that recognizes an  event and triggers code to run is called  an event listener and the code it  triggers is called an event  The ActionListener interface  handler event listeners are way more  complicated than what we can do right  now but swing actually that awt package  I keep glossing over can take care of  that part for us with something called  action listener so we'll need to use  that in our class in the same way we use  stuff from  jframe but remember that in Java  multiple inheritance isn't  allowed a cousin who's a close friend  can't be both a friend and a family  member a class can only have one super  class to get around the multiple  inheritance problem action listener  isn't actually a class it's something  called an interface  an interface is like a partial class  that establishes a set of rules and by  rules what I really mean is that it  establishes one or more methods that we  have to create in any class that uses it  and instead of extending a class like we  did with jframe we'll implement the  action listener  interface we can let that take care of  the listening and we can focus on  writing an event handler which is what  the program does in response to the  event let's see how that works  we'll begin with another import  statement we need uh java.  aw.  event so that we can deal with some of  this event handling stuff and we're  going to move on to this line of code  where we Define our class and we've set  it up to extend jframe and we know that  we can't uh keep putting extends and and  extend other classes Java only let you  extend one class what we can do though  is we can implement an interface and so  we're going to use the implements  keyword and the interface I want is  called action listening now right off  the bat we start getting an  error what an interface does in Java is  it defines one or more methods but it  doesn't write any code for those methods  so it it decides on a name and a return  type and whatever arguments it needs but  there's no curly braces with the code  that runs when that method is ex execut  it the compiler can't deal with that it  needs to have code so if we're going to  implement an interface we have to write  the code for that method or however many  methods there are it's a little bit like  overwriting except we're not replacing  code that was written in a super class  we're implementing it for the first time  we're writing the code for the first  time the method that action listener  defines and needs us to complete is  called action performed and that's  actually our event handler so it was  something we were going to have to write  anyway vs code recognizes what the  problem is and if I hover over that um  the the name of my class it offers a  quick fix and the fix is to you know  write the code for the the methods that  aren't implemented so you don't have to  let VSS code do it for you but let's go  ahead and click that and see what it  comes up with I'll have to scroll down  Writing an event handler with actionPerformed()  to the bottom to find it and here it is  it has the uh override compiler  directive because it does need to make  sure that it correctly replaces uh the  definition in our  interface and then it's put a couple  lines of code in there that look really  unfamiliar and possibly a little  intimidating or scary this is just  placeholder code what it actually does  is it causes an error to happen if we  try and run this code because it doesn't  want us to forget that we we did that  maybe in a hurry and then we go off and  work on other stuff and we forget to  come back with it to finish this when we  run our program it's going to crash when  it gets to this point so we are meant to  delete this code and replace it with  whatever the real code is that we want  I'm also going to take care of one  housekeeping thing that is just one of  my little um Obsession things here I'm  going to put this action performed  method above my main method I already  feel weird enough having this main  method in this class as I keep saying  I'm going to scoot it down to the bottom  because it really is kind of  separate now I just want to create a  little personalized greeting and display  it in that label at the bottom of my  form I'm going to write this with three  separate lines of code even though we  could do it in one and that's just  because I want to be clear exactly what  I'm doing and what the different pieces  of this are intended to do so the first  thing I'm going going to do is create a  string  variable and I'll call it  greeting and I'm just going to put kind  of hello and the first part of our  greeting in  there and next what I'm going to do is  I'm going to add on to that string by  grabbing whatever the user has typed  into that text field so I'm going to say  plus equals and now I'm going to  retrieve this Dot  txt  name. get  text so as the name suggests the get  text method goes to that text box text  field and retrieves whatever is in there  now if I've left a a default string in  there when I first created it then it  will get that back out but if the user  has replaced that with something else  get text is going to get that for me and  I'm going to add it on to my little  greeting string here and finally I want  to take this greeting string that I've  created and I want to display that in my  label that I've created for that purpose  so I'm going to say this. lbl  greeting. set  text and in my set text method I'm going  to pass in the greeting that I've set  up so that makes sense right in the  widget that is intended for the user to  put in input I'm going to get that  information out and in the widget that  is intended to display my result I'm  going to set T text back into it let's  run this and try it  out we'll see what happens when I type  in a name and click the  button type in Tim and click and nothing  happens let's take a look at why  Attaching a listener  remember that there are two different  pieces of code that are involved in this  uh event handling uh interaction we've  created the event handler but we need an  event listener to trigger this code and  cause it to execute so what we have to  do is we have to find the widget that is  related to this event and we have to  attach a listener to  it so I'm going to move up into my  Constructor here where I've done all of  my work with these different widgets and  the widget that I care about for this  event is the button right so I'm going  to add a little space down here I'm  going to say this button  submit. add action  listener all right and what this is  going to accept as a parameter is an  object that has this action performed  method that it's going to run now that  is set up this way because we could be  using a different object we could have a  different class where we we've defined  our event handler and we would need a  reference to that in our case our action  performed method is right here so we  need to attach this listener uh to the  event within this same class so I'm just  going to put the keyword this as we've  been doing kind of all  along now let's try it again  again type Tim click submit and sure  enough it says hello Tim so now we're  getting somewhere right this might not  be the most exciting program in the  world but this little example has opened  up a whole new way for you to write your  programs before guies you knew how to  display text and get input in the  terminal or console with text Fields  labels and buttons you can do the same  thing but you can do it in a goey that  looks a lot nicer for the user and is  probably a lot more what they are  expecting when they open a  program of course there are lots more  interesting widgets out there that we  can use and we'll explore those in  another video
