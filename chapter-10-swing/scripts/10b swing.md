let's start out by looking at a fairly  simple guey like this if we think of  these widgets as objects we've already  got a bunch of classes to write  label text  box combo  box  checkbox and  button that's a lot of work before we  can even get our goey on the screen so  there's a lot library of pre-built  widgets we can use called  swing actually there are a handful of  libraries I do want to mention Java FX  which is a newer and really better  Library than swing we're not going to  use it because it does require a little  installation and configuration that I  don't want to make students deal with  especially if they're new to  programming and we're using swing to  show fundamental concepts which will  transition over to Java FS X if you want  to explore that later in swing every  widget needs to be a part of a hierarchy  of containers before we can put a menu  bar at the top and start putting widgets  into the content pane we have to create  a top level  container in most cases that's going to  be a  jframe jframe will have some additional  uses for us later on but for now we can  just think of it as something we need to  put in place to hold all of our widgets  let's take a look at pretty much the  most basic swing program we can make  we'll need to import the swing package  so we have access to all that widgy  goodness so don't forget that notice  that swing is considered an extension to  Java so it's import Java x. swing rather  than java.  swing inside our main method we'll start  by declaring and instantiating a jframe  object which we'll just call frame in  the jframe Constructor call we can pass  in the title of the window and that will  be displayed at the  top next we'll set the size of the  window which here is 300 pixels wide and  150 pixels  High last but not least we need to  display our amazing window instantiating  a jframe object doesn't display it on  the screen we can use the set visible  method to do  that and and it's looking pretty good  it's looking pretty boring there's not  much to it but it is running notice  though that it's actually running as a  separate program you can see the little  Java icon up here and if I click on the  Red X or the Red Dot depending on your  operating system it hides the window but  it doesn't actually stop the program  from running  anymore I can take care of that easily  Enough by killing the terminal in vs  code or by clicking the stop button so  this isn't a big deal but we do need to  understand that that is the default  behavior for a jframe because often a  program will open a different window  once the user closes the one they're  working with we can change that behavior  to cause it to close the entire program  using something called the default close  operation on our jframe object so I'm  going to call set default close  operation and what I have to pass in is  something called an enumeration  uh so I'm going to type jframe and get  that dot and now it's got a list of all  these they're basically like constants  that are defined inside that jframe  class that we can use here and so I want  exit on close that's the behavior I'm  looking  for let's try that  out so once again I've got my guey to  appear and this time if I close the Red  X it has stopped the entire program from  running I can see I don't have those  controls up here anymore and that icon  is no longer in my  taskbar once we have a jframe in place  and have set up how we want it to look  and behave we can start adding our  widgets the obvious place to start is to  display some text I know it kind of  defeats the purpose here but sometimes a  guy still needs to display some text in  a goei we usually display text using a  label which is implemented with the J  label class in  swing when we start creating widgets we  need to be thoughtful about how we name  them goys can end up having a lot of  different widgets and when we're writing  code that references them it's easy to  get confused unlike most other things in  Java there's no prescribed naming  convention but there are a couple common  approaches and what they all have in  common is that you need to describe the  widget's purpose in the  guey one convention is to prefix the  name name with an abbreviation that  indicates the widget type so lbl hello  for a label that says hello the prefix  for a text box might be  txt BTN for a button and so on I tend to  do it this way because it's common in C  and I've spent a lot of time in that  other people append the widget type on  the end but they usually don't  abbreviate it so you'd have hello  label and some Psychopaths don't  indicate the widget type at all hey it's  your  funeral we'll want to get this J label  into our frame before we make the frame  visible otherwise we'll need to force  the frame to render the window again so  I'll make some space here and I'll  instantiate A J label I'll call it lbl  hello and this is pretty straightforward  The Constructor call I make is going to  accept the text that I want to display  so I'll say hello world because that's  how I always start these kinds of  things at this point the object exists  in memory but it isn't part of our guey  we need to put it into our frame using  the add  method frame. add and just pass in the  name of the  widget and let's give that a  shot okay now I know what you might be  thinking this isn't that big of a deal  it's not that hard this guy could have  taught us this a long time ago instead  of making us spend so much time on those  boring text based  programs not so fast let's go ahead and  add another  label so J label I'll call this one  lbl greeting equals new  J label and for this one I'll  say welcome to my  amazing  cooy and don't forget which I often do  to add on uh that new label into our  frame and let's take a look at at  that H it's not working like we hoped if  we want to add multiple widgets to a  frame I have to tell it how to organize  everything it uses something that's  called a layout manager and there are a  handful of different choices the easiest  one is called flow layout so let's go up  here where we're kind of first setting  up our frame and let's use the uh set  layout method now what this accepts when  I'm doing my parameters here it has to  be something uh a subass of something  called layout manager and the one we  want like I said is a flow layout so I'm  going to put new because we have to make  an object um  flow layout and parentheses because  there's a Constructor call in there now  vs code is not recognizing this the the  layout managers are not part of Swing  they are part of something called uh a  WT which is Way Beyond what I want to  get into right now but I do have to  import that java.  awt star and that gives us our layout  managers it gives us some colors and  some other things that we'll use kind of  along the way uh let's go ahead and try  running  that okay so both labels got displayed  but it's just kind of jammed them  together let's go back to the code  and let's try making that second label a  little bit longer that takes up a lot of  space and let's try running it  now this might make it a little more  clear what is happening because you can  see that it's put that second label on  the next line down incidentally it's  also too big to fit completely so it  centers it and it kind of crops the  edges what a flow layout does is a lot  like the way a word processor behaves it  goes to the top left and it starts  adding widgets from left to right and  then when it gets to the right hand side  and runs out of room it just goes down  to the next line and continues from  there this isn't necessarily the  behavior we want but it lets it lets us  get one more widget on the screen uh for  now as I said in a previous video  there's a reason we start out using  print line statements look at how much  code it takes us just to get a couple of  lines of text on the screen in a way  that doesn't even look great and it  doesn't even do anything interactive yet  for that we'll need to move on and learn  about handling gooey events which we'll  do in the next video
