# 10A - Introduction to GUIs

Six and a half minutes of gooey goodness. *Ahem*, GUI goodness. 

Learn about the development and purpose of the graphical user interface, from Xerox to Apple to Swing.

00:00 Early computer user interfaces
01:30 The "first" GUI
02:29 Widgets and event-driven programming
04:43 "Decoupling" the user interface

# 10B - Intro to Swing in Java

Time to get into the Swing of GUI programming in Java. Click the red x (or red dot) on those boring old console applications and bring your programs into the modern age.

Here we'll explore the Swing framework, which gives us a bunch of classes we can use to build GUI applications in Java. We'll look at JFrame, JLabel and FlowLayout, and I'll nerd out about naming conventions.

01:02 Swing container hierarchy and a basic Swing program
02:34 Setting the default close operation
04:09 Adding a JLabel
06:52 Adding another JLabel with FlowLayout

# 10C - Swing Event Handling

I know what you're thinking, but this video isn't about THAT kind of "swing event." Settle down!

Make your Swing application a little more OOP-ish by extending JFrame. Then, learn about how event-driven programming is implemented in Swing using listeners and event handlers. And we'll take a couple of quick detours to learn a little about how widgets are sized in a FlowLayout application and how to use a Java interface.

00:00 Extending JFrame
11:50 Setting the size of a widget
16:16 Event-driven Programming introduction
17:17 The ActionListener interface
20:24 Writing an event handler with actionPerformed()
23:56 Attaching a listener

# 10D - Calculations in Swing

We're full-fledged swingers now, able to display widgets and respond to the events they generate. But our programs still do much.

See how to create Swing GUI programs that work with values entered into JTextField and JCheckBox widgets. This simple example shows how you can start to do more advanced (well, intermediate) things with you GUI applications.

00:00 Intro, import statements, and interface implementation
03:05 Retrieving and converting JTextField values
08:30 Streamlining the retrieval
09:57 Outputting results to a JLabel
10:57 Getting the status of a JCheckBox

# 10E - More Swing Widgets

Widget, widgets, everywhere, and not a box to check!

This is a look at a few more of the commonly-used Swing widgets: JCheckBox, JRadioButton, and JComboBox.

00:40 JCheckBox
02:33 JRadioButton
05:57 JComboBox

# 10F - Swing Layouts

Our GUIs have been about to go with the flow, but it sure is tough to get everything where I want it!

This video takes a quick look at a few different Swing layout managers: FlowLayout, JPanel for organization, GridLayout, BorderLayout. And we'll see how we can create more complex arrangements by nesting layouts.

00:13 FlowLayout
01:26 JPanel
02:29 GridLayout
03:11 BorderLayout
04:41 Nesting layouts
05:35 Front-end vs Back-end design + visual design tools
