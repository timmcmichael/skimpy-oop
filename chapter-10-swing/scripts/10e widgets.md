creating a rich and userfriendly  experience with a GUI takes more than  just labels and text boxes swing like  other guei Frameworks provides a wide  variety of widgets for making an  effective user interface in fact there  are far more widgets than we have time  to cover but I do want to show you a few  of the more common widgets so you can  use them in your own programs check  boxes radio buttons and combo  boxes each of these widgets has a  different role within a guey so we'll  look at them one at a  time a checkbox is a widget that allows  you to make a binary selection true  false yes no onof and so on you can use  a single checkbox like you often see  when you have to agree to terms and  conditions or you can use multiple check  boxes you might use this to give the  user options allowing them to to select  as many as they'd like on a quiz this  would be a multiple answer style  question select all of the correct  answers in swing checkboxes are  implemented using the j checkbox  class the J checkbox widget includes  both the checkbox graphic and the text  that goes next to it here's how to use  it we'll just declare our J checkbox  objects as Fields along with all our  other widgets I'm using chk as a prefix  and then the last name of the individual  the user can select as always the most  important thing about your names is  being clear and  descriptive don't forget that you have  to add your J checkbox instance to the  guey just like any other  widget to see if the user has toggled on  on a j checkbox we can use the is  selected method we do need to check  every J check box to make sure that we  cover all of the options and notice that  we're not using any else or else if  statements that's because each check  boox is independent of the others so we  have to check them  all obviously you'll end up putting  whatever code you need inside each of  these if blocks they're just empty here  to keep the code clean for the sake of  the video  I just said that each J check box is  independent of the others and a user can  select as many or as few as they want  right well sometimes we only want the  user to pick one selection from all of  the choices that's the purpose of radio  buttons a radio button is actually the  exact same thing as a checkbox but it's  generally rendered with a circle and a  DOT rather than a square and a check  mark other than that the only difference  is that radio buttons are placed in a  group and the user is only allowed to  select one choice from the group if they  select another then the first choice is  toggled off you could put a bunch of  check marks in a group and theyd behave  the same way and yes if you added radio  buttons without putting them in a group  they would behave like independent  checkboxes and allow multiple selections  but the subtle difference in their  appearance lets the user know how they  function so we should use them in the  convention  ways learning where the name radio  buttons comes from might help you  remember how they  work when automakers first started  putting radios into their cars they  weren't digital they had dials and you  had to turn them in order to tune to a  different  station and in order to remember your  favorite stations they had physical  buttons that actually moved the dial to  a specific spot when pressed the button  stayed down until you pressed another  button and then your previous button  popped back up radio buttons in AU GOI  were named after those Old School radio  buttons the swing class for a radio  button is not surprisingly called j  radio button when we implement it we're  also going to use a class called button  group it's not visible in the guey but  it's necessary to make the radio buttons  behave like radio buttons and only allow  one selection the j radio buttton  objects don't even need to be near each  each other on the screen for the group  to work but to make your guey clear to  the user you should keep a group of  radio buttons close together and you can  have multiple button groups with j radio  buttons in them and the user will be  able to select one choice from each  group here's how j radio buttons work  declaring and instantiating our j radio  button objects will be exactly the same  as our J check boxes which of course is  exactly the same as our other  widgets I use the pref fix rdb for my  radio buttons instead of chk like for  checkboxes and you also see that I've  declared a button group object with the  prefix  grp in order to make the radio buttons  behave as radio buttons and only allow  one selection we have to add all of the  j radio button instances to the button  group instance in much the same way we  add them to the  frame the only other place we see a  difference between j radio button and J  checkbox is when we test to see which  option was  selected since only one selection is  possible I like to use if else if for  the checks that way as soon as we find  one where is selected returns true we  can stop looking that's pretty minor but  it is more efficient if we stop once we  have a  selection the last widget we'll look at  here is called called a combo box  because it works like a combination of a  drop-down list and a text box it allows  the user to choose from a selection of  items much like a radio button but the  user can also begin typing as the  developer you can decide how the combo  box behaves if the user starts to type a  non-editable combo box is probably what  you associate with the term drop-down  list the user is only allowed to select  from the items on the list so typing  will basically search through the list  and make it easier for the user to  complete their  selection but you can also make a combo  box editable which means that the list  of items is sort of like a bunch of  suggestions the user can pick one of  those options or they can type something  that's not on the list this kind of  editable combo box is almost like  autocorrect the user can accept one of  the suggestions or just keep typing and  put in whatever they want  so that gives us two very different uses  for combo boxes but in either case a big  advantage to a combo box is how little  space it takes on the screen you could  give the user a bunch of radio buttons  and that would serve the same purpose as  a non-editable dropdown but you'd be  sacrificing a lot of real estate in your  window to do it sometimes that's worth  it either because you have plenty of  space or because it's just really  important to make all those choices  obvious to the  user like when they're agree to those  terms and conditions that are so  annoying there is another big advantage  to combo boxes that's worth mentioning  even though we'll only touch on it a  little bit here sometimes the list of  choices is pulled from some data source  like a web API or a database at the time  we're writing the code we might not know  what those choices are or even how many  of them there are so radio buttons  wouldn't be  practical it's much easier to just  populate the combo box options from that  data source when the program  runs to give us all of this  functionality swing has the J combo box  class since combo boxes are all about  flexibility J combo box has a feature  that's probably new to you it's a  generic  class now Java generics are a fairly  large topic and not really something I'm  interested in at the moment so I'm just  going to show you how to use it  correctly for now  if you declare a j combo box in the same  way we've been declaring our other  widgets you're going to see a compiler  warning A J combo box is made up of  items and those items can be lots of  different things I might want a combo  box of integers or doubles for example  so I need to specify that data type in  our case we're going to use strings so  the Syntax for generics in Java is the  angle brackets  we put the type name in Brackets  immediately after J combo  box and that makes the compiler happy  this doesn't seem like a big deal so why  not just count that as our lesson in  generics well for one thing I can only  put a reference type in those angle  brackets Not A Primitive type like int  as the Beatles themselves once  said you can't do  that you have to use what's called a  wrapper class like  integer and that's only the start of the  rabbit hole we can end up in so for now  we're just going to specify our data  type in those brackets and set aside  generics until another  time okay so now we can instantiate our  J combo box and start adding items to it  which works a lot like you'd probably  expect oops there's that generic type  syntax again but anyway we can just add  items to the instance with the add item  method this is a lot like a raise where  you end up having to write a bunch of  separate statements to populate all of  your data but there is a shortcut and it  actually uses arrays in fact I can pass  an array into the Constructor call when  I instantiate my J combo box and the  Constructor will add all of those  elements to the object's item  list here's an example that uses two  different arrays to populate a pair of J  combo box  objects whether you add the items  individually or use an array to populate  the J combo box you can then add that  widget to your frame just like any other  widget once we've got our J combo box up  and running we need to be able to see  what the user picked and here's another  example of some flexibility offered by J  combo box we have multiple ways to  retrieve the user  selection much like an array the  collection of items in the combo box has  index numbers starting at zero so one  way to find out what the user selected  is to retrieve that index number and now  I can use that index number in my if  statement or however I need to work with  that  selection you can also retrieve the item  itself using the get selected item  method as part of that J combo box  flexibility it gets returned as an  instance of the object class remember  that class that every Java class extends  from our lesson on inheritance so to use  it as a string we'll downcast The  Returned object to a string and another  little peek at that rabbit hole we're  trying to avoid but the syntax is pretty  easy and once I've converted that into a  string I can work with it just like any  other string there are a lot of other  widgets available in the swing framework  but now you know how to use the most  common and useful ones for General  programs with these examples you can  probably figure out how to use most of  the others I encourage you to try them  out and see how they look
