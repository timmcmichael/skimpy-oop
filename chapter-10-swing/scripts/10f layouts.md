arranging your widgets within a jframe  can be pretty frustrating swing provides  a number of layout managers to help we  started learning swing by using a flow  layout which puts the first widget in  the top left corner and each additional  widget gets placed to the right once it  reaches the edge of the container it  starts a new row so it works basically  like Microsoft Word you're typing just  goes across from left to right and when  you get to the right Edge it bumps your  new word down to the next line flow  layout is easy to use but the results  can be confusing for the user in this  example the text boxes can get separated  from the labels that tell the user what  to  input resizing the window demonstrates  how the flow layout adjusts and wraps  widgets to the next row and you might be  able to dial in a width that kind of  makes sense so I guess you could just  set the size to that I could also set  the preferred size for these different  widgets to help keep things looking  consistent and also control where those  new rows are started it's not really  ideal but it can work for simple  goys and note that though I didn't show  it here you can change the alignment of  widgets within the flow layout by adding  that as a parameter in your Constructor  call one thing that can help is grouping  widget wigets together swing provides a  class called J panel that is basically a  generic container that will hold  widgets in this example I've added a j  panel as one of my fields and  instantiated it in the Constructor I've  also set the background color so we can  see the panel when we run the program  the panel is going to hold widgets  related to  John next I'm going to add the label and  text box to the J panel instead of to  the frame and then I'm going to add the  panel to the frame you can see the red  background showing that the J panel is  holding our label and text box and now  when I resize the window the J panel is  treated as a single widget that keeps  them together when we get to the right  edge of the frame I can use as many  panels as I need so I'd probably want to  put each label text box pair in separate  panels so they always stay  together but there's also life beyond  flow layout a really straightforward  layout manager is the grid layout which  establishes a grid of cells that you can  use to arrange your  widgets when you set the layout you'll  add the number of rows and columns to  the grid layout Constructor call in this  case I've made a grid with three rows  and two  columns when you add widgets to a grid  layout they are put in from left to  right and top to bottom so here's the  result the grid will fill the entire  container and the cells are going to be  the same size  by thinking about your guey as being in  a grid you can often sketch out the  basic layout on a sheet of paper or in a  table in Microsoft Word and then write  the code to produce that the other  layout manager we'll look at here is  called border layout this lets you  position widgets in different regions of  the container like the top or bottom  left or  right in this example I've created five  different J panels and placed them  around the frame in the positions  indicated by the labels  page start and Page end are at the top  and the bottom of the screen line start  and line end are the sides and Center is  well the  center to use this approach you'll  specify border layout as the layout for  the frame you'll specify the position of  each widget when you add them to the  frame using predefined constants  actually enumerations that are available  in the Border layout  class I've added labels to the panels  and now I'll add the panels to the  frame border layout. page start puts the  first panel up at the top for example  there are different constants you can  use for example you could specify Border  layout. North for the top of the screen  and east south and west for the other  regions they behave a little differently  than page start and Page end for example  so you can experiment with the those  directional references to see the  difference there are a bunch of other  layout managers in swing too many for us  to cover here but we haven't yet seen  the most useful trick for organizing the  layout of widgets  nesting often there isn't a layout  manager that works perfectly for what  you're trying to accomplish like in this  example this colorcoded version helps  visualize the way I've laid out these  components the pink color is the frame  itself and the label is added directly  to that the teal is a panel and I've  applied a 3x2 grid layout to that panel  before adding the  checkboxes the orange color represents a  separate panel with the button and it's  really just to demonstrate an additional  panel so that gives us three elements  the label the checkbox panel and the  button panel and I've added all of those  to the frame within a flow layout  using panels with their own layout  managers gives you a ton of  flexibility now I often use a restaurant  analogy when I talk about decoupling  code from a user interface the guey is  front of house like the servers and  bartenders and the classes we write are  the back of house like the  cooks there's a similar analogy related  to guey design itself and it's based on  one of my golden rules of coding  programmers are terrible at UI design  you can always tell when a user  interface was created by a programmer  because it sucks okay that might not  always be true but it brings up this  idea of using  Specialists the cooks don't have to have  great people skills because they can  focus on cooking the servers don't have  to know how to cook and they can focus  on good customer service it makes both  of them better at their jobs and most  importantly it makes for a better  experience for the customers in soft  Ware development it's often better if a  coder can just focus on writing code and  then we can get someone with a great  design background to develop the guey to  help with this there are tools that  allow someone to lay out a guey and the  tool will generate the swing code to  produce that guey that makes it possible  for a non-programmer to lay out a good  user interface I mentioned this because  I want to acknowledge that those tools  exist and can make our lives a lot  easier but in this course we're learning  how to write code so we won't be using  tools to create our guey for us on my  assignments you need to write the guei  code the old fashion way but I encourage  you to explore some of those tools  outside of class and as is almost always  the case with these videos there's a lot  more out there that I haven't had time  to cover but this should give you enough  flexibility to create the goys you need  for your own programs  CIS150AB
