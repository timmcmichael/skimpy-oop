=== Graphical User Interfaces

Until now, we've been creating _console applications_, in which the entire user interface is text-based. 
Though many utility applications are text-based, those are generally used by "power users," software developers, and system administrators.
End users are used to applications that rely graphical elements to interact with the user.
This is called a _graphical user interface_, which is abbreviated as _GUI_ and pronounced "gooey."

GUIs on desktop and laptop computers have elements like windows, buttons, text fields, and checkboxes, and the user interacts using a mouse or touchpad.
These GUI elements are called _widgets_ or _controls_. Mobile applications have similar widgets, but they are designed for touchscreens and are generally more simplified than desktop applications.

=== The Swing Library

The code required to create GUI widgets is complex and far beyond our current skills, but we can use pre-built GUI widgets written by other developers.
These are typically bundled into _libraries_, or _frameworks_, that we can use in our own programs.
The two most common GUI frameworks for Java are called _Swing_ and _JavaFX_; we'll use Swing in this course because it's a little simpler for beginners.

NOTE: JavaFX is newer and more powerful than Swing, but it's also more complex and has a steeper learning curve. The concepts learned in Swing will transfer to JavaFX, so learning Swing first is a good idea.

The use Swing classes, you simply need to add an `import` statement at the top of your Java file:

`import javax.swing.*;`

You'll begin by instantiating a `JFrame` object, which is the main window of your application.
You can use setters on the `JFrame` object to set attributes like the title and size of the window; you'll also want to set the attribute that determines what happens when the user closes the window.
You can then add other widgets to the frame, like buttons, text fields, and labels.
Finally, you'll set the frame to be visible, which will cause the window to appear on the screen.

.Example of a simple GUI using Swing
[source,java]
----
import javax.swing.*;

public class BasicGUI {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Hello, World!");
        frame.setSize(300, 200);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        JLabel lblHello = new JLabel("It's so gooey!");
        frame.add(lblHello);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

}
----

This code creates a window with the title "Hello, World!" and a label that says "It's so gooey!".

As you can see, the code to create a simple GUI is not much more complex than creating a console application, which is why we've waited until now to introduce GUIs.
