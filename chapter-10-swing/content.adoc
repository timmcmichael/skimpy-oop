=== Graphical User Interfaces

Until now, we've been creating _console applications_, in which the entire user interface is text-based. 
Though many utility applications are text-based, those are generally used by "power users," software developers, and system administrators.
End users are used to applications that rely graphical elements to interact with the user.
This is called a _graphical user interface_, which is abbreviated as _GUI_ and pronounced "gooey."

GUIs on desktop and laptop computers have elements like windows, buttons, text fields, and checkboxes, and the user interacts using a mouse or touchpad.
These GUI elements are called _widgets_ or _controls_. Mobile applications have similar widgets, but they are designed for touchscreens and are generally more simplified than desktop applications.

=== The Swing Library

The code required to create and display a functioning GUI is complex and far beyond our current skills, but we can use pre-built GUI widgets written by other developers.
These are typically bundled into _libraries_, or _frameworks_, that we can use in our own programs.
The two most common GUI frameworks for Java are called _Swing_ and _JavaFX_; we'll use Swing in this course because it's a little simpler for beginners and does not require any additional installations.

NOTE: JavaFX is newer and more powerful than Swing, but it's also more complex and has a steeper learning curve. The concepts learned in Swing will transfer to JavaFX, so learning Swing is a great place to start.

To use Swing classes, we simply need to add an `import` statement at the top of our Java file:

`import javax.swing.*;`

We'll begin by instantiating a `JFrame` object, which is the main window of our application.
We can use setters on the `JFrame` object to set attributes like the title and size of the window; we'll also want to set the attribute that determines what happens when the user closes the window.
We can then add other widgets to the frame, like buttons, text fields, and labels.
Finally, we'll set the frame to be visible, which will cause the window to appear on the screen.

.Example of a simple GUI using Swing
[source,java]
----
import javax.swing.*;

public class BasicGUI {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Hello, World!");
        frame.setSize(300, 200);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        JLabel lblHello = new JLabel("It's so gooey!");
        frame.add(lblHello);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

}
----

This code creates a window with the title "Hello, World!" and a label that says "It's so gooey!".

NOTE: The `JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE` attribute tells the program to exit when the user closes the window. If we don't set this attribute, the program will continue running in the background after the window is closed. There are a few other options for this attribute, but `EXIT_ON_CLOSE` is the most common.

As you can see, the code to create a simple GUI is is a little more complex than the single `println()` statement of an equivalent console application, which is why we've waited until now to learn it.

=== Event-Driven Programming with Swing

A GUI application offers a lot more flexibility than a console application, since the user can interact with the program in many ways.
In a console application, the program runs from top to bottom, and the user can only interact by typing text.
In a GUI application, the user can click buttons, type in text fields, and select items from drop-down lists.
This means that the program must be able to respond to these events; we call this _event-driven programming_, and it is a key concept in GUI programming.

In Swing, we can add _event listeners_ to widgets, which are objects that respond to events.
For example, we can add an event listener to a button that will run a method when the button is clicked.
The method that runs in response to an event is called an _event handler_.
Once we've added an event listener to a widger, the event handler is like any other method in our program, and we can write it to do whatever we want.

=== Processing User Input with Swing

Once we've learned how to work with widgets and add event listeners, we can put everything together to create a GUI application that gets input from the user, performs actions or calculations with that data, and displays the results.

=== Widgets

Using `JLabel` and `JTextField`, we've been about to create GUI programs that function much like console applications, but that doesn't really take advantage of the power of GUIs.
A well-designed GUI application utilizes specialized widgets that are designed for specific types of user input and output.

Here are some common widgets and their purposes:

JLabel:: Displays text or an image.
JTextField:: Allows the user to type in a single line of text.
JTextArea:: Allows the user to type in multiple lines of text.
JButton:: A clickable button that can run a method when clicked.
JCheckBox:: A checkbox that can be checked or unchecked.
JRadioButton:: A radio button that can be selected or deselected, and can be grouped with other radio buttons to limit the user to selecting only one.
JComboBox:: A drop-down list that allows the user to select one item from a list.

There are many more widgets in the Swing framework, but these will cover most of what you'll need for basic GUI applications. 
There is a great deal of documentation available online for the Swing framework, so you can always look up how to use a specific widget.

TIP: Use widgets as they are intended, even if they are able to be used in other ways, such as displaying output in a text field. Users are accustomed to certain behaviors from widgets, and using them in unexpected ways can make the application harder to use.

==== Widget Naming Conventions

When naming widgets, it's a good idea to use a consistent naming convention that makes it clear what type of widget it is.
There are a variety of conventions for naming widgets, but two are most common:

* Prefix the name to identify the widget type, like `lbl` for a label, `txt` for a text field, or `btn` for a button.
* Append the type of widget to the end of the name, like `helloLabel`, `nameTextField`, or `submitButton`.

I use the prefix method in my code, mostly because I'm used to that from C# programming (where that's the preferred style), but you can use either method in my class.
The most important thing is to be consistent in your naming so that anyone reading your code can easily understand what each widget is for.

=== GUI Layouts

As we add more widgets to our GUI, we'll need to consider how they are arranged on the screen.
While we can set the position of each widget manually, this is tedious and doesn't work well when the window is resized.
Instead, we should use _layout managers_, which are objects that arrange widgets in a specific way and respond to window and screen sizes in predictable ways. 
Think of a layout manager as a set of rules that determine how widgets are arranged in a window.

The Swing framework is itself built on top of *another* framework called the _Abstract Window Toolkit_, or _AWT_.
Swing hides most of that from us by implementing classes that extend the AWT classes.
For example, the `JLabel` class is a Swing widget that extends the `Label` class from AWT.
So we don't directly use AWT very often, but the exception to that is layout managers.
Layout managers are part of AWT, so we'll have to import them from the `java.awt` package:

`import java.awt.*;`

There are several layout managers available in AWT, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
The most common layout managers are:

FlowLayout:: Widgets are arranged in a single row or column, and wrap to the next row or column when the window is resized.
GridLayout:: Widgets are arranged in a grid, with a specified number of rows and columns.
BorderLayout:: Widgets are arranged in five regions: north, south, east, west, and center.

To create more complex layouts, we can nest layout managers, which means that we can put a layout manager inside another layout manager.

NOTE: There are tools that allow us to create GUIs visually, by dragging and dropping widgets onto a window, and then generating the code that will produce the GUI. But our goal is to learn how layout managers work, so we'll be creating our GUIs by writing the code ourselves. For GUI designs that don't have to be turned into an obnoxious professor for a grade, you're welcome to take advantage of these tools.
